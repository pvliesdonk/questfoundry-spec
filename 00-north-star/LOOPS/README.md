# Targeted Loops — Index & Chooser

Targeted loops are **short, goal-driven passes** that change **Hot** and only reach **Cold** after
Gatekeeper checks. Pick one, run it, hand off cleanly, repeat. This page is your map.

## Quick chooser (use-when → outcome)

| Loop                        | Use when…                                                                      | Outcome                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Story Spark**             | You need to add/reshape plot topology (hubs, loops, gateways) and seed drafts. | Topology delta + section briefs & draft prose + fresh hooks.                       |
| **World Genesis**           | You want extensive worldbuilding **before** plot (canon-first approach).       | Canon packs + codex baseline + style anchors + constraint manifest for Plotwright. |
| **Canon Transfer (Export)** | Project complete; export canon for sequel/shared universe.                     | Canon Transfer Package with invariant/mutable canon + codex + timeline + entities. |
| **Canon Transfer (Import)** | Starting new project with imported canon from prior project.                   | Seeded Hot/Cold with imported canon; constraint docs for creative roles.           |
| **Hook Harvest**            | You've got scattered hooks from drafting/research and need order.              | Harvest Sheet: accepted/deferred/rejected hooks with owners & next loops.          |
| **Lore Deepening**          | Accepted hooks must become **canon** (backstory, timeline, causality).         | Canon Pack + notes to Plotwright/Scene + player-safe summaries for Codex.          |
| **Codex Expansion**         | Players need terms explained; new canon landed.                                | Player-safe Codex Pack + crosslink map; no spoilers.                               |
| **Style Tune-up**           | Voice/register/motif drift is visible.                                         | Style Addendum + edit notes + pre-gate on Style/Presentation.                      |
| **Art Touch-up**            | You want illustration **plans** and maybe renders.                             | Art Plan (+ optional renders & determinism logs) ready to merge or defer.          |
| **Audio Pass**              | You want sound **plans** and maybe assets.                                     | Audio Plan (+ optional assets & reproducibility notes) ready to merge or defer.    |
| **Translation Pass**        | A language slice is needed (glossary or full surfaces).                        | Language Pack with glossary, register map, localized surfaces, coverage %.         |
| **Binding Run**             | You must ship a **view** on Cold (MD/HTML/EPUB/PDF).                           | Export bundle stamped with snapshot ID + View Log.                                 |
| **Narration Dry-Run**       | PN should playtest the current view in-world.                                  | PN playtest notes → small follow-ups (style/codex/binder).                         |

## Loop summaries (one-pagers)

### Story Spark

- **Goal**: meaningful nonlinearity (hubs/loops/gateways) with legible choices.
- **Deliver**: topology delta; briefs; draft prose; hook list; pre-gate notes.
- **Hand-off**: Hook Harvest → Lore Deepening → Style/Codex as needed.

### World Genesis

- **Goal**: build extensive worldbuilding **before** plot design (canon-first approach).
- **Deliver**: canon packs (geography, magic, history, factions); codex baseline; style anchors;
  timeline foundation; constraint manifest.
- **Hand-off**: Story Spark (Plotwright works within canon constraints).

### Canon Transfer (Export)

- **Goal**: package project canon for export to sequel/shared universe.
- **Deliver**: Canon Transfer Package (invariant/mutable canon, codex baseline, timeline, entity
  registry).
- **Hand-off**: Next project imports package via Canon Transfer (Import).

### Canon Transfer (Import)

- **Goal**: seed new project with imported canon from prior project.
- **Deliver**: Invariant canon → Cold (immutable); mutable canon → Hot (extensible); constraint docs
  for creative roles.
- **Hand-off**: Story Spark (plot within imported canon constraints).

### Hook Harvest

- **Goal**: collect, cluster, triage hooks (narrative/scene/factual/taxonomy).
- **Deliver**: Harvest Sheet (accepted/deferred/rejected, owners, next loop).
- **Hand-off**: Lore Deepening / Story Spark / Codex / Style.

### Lore Deepening

- **Goal**: turn accepted hooks into spoiler-level **canon**.
- **Deliver**: Canon Pack (answers, timeline, constraints) + player-safe summaries.
- **Hand-off**: Codex Expansion (summaries), Story Spark (topology notes), Scene Smith (prose
  notes).

### Codex Expansion

- **Goal**: player-safe comprehension, not revelation.
- **Deliver**: entries (Overview/Usage/Context/See-also/Notes) + crosslinks.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (for export), Translator (glossary seeds).

### Style Tune-up

- **Goal**: correct voice/register/motif drift without changing structure.
- **Deliver**: Style Addendum + targeted edit notes + pre-gate.
- **Hand-off**: Owners apply edits; Binder/PN/Translator informed if surfaces changed.

### Art Touch-up

- **Goal**: decide **what** to illustrate and **why**; optionally render.
- **Deliver**: Art Plan (subject, purpose, composition, caption, constraints, alt guidance) +
  optional renders & determinism logs.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (inclusion options), Style (caption tone).

### Audio Pass

- **Goal**: decide **what** to hear and **why**; optionally produce assets.
- **Deliver**: Audio Plan (cue, placement, intensity, captions, safety) + optional assets &
  reproducibility notes.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (inclusion), Style/Translator (phrasing & VO).

### Translation Pass

- **Goal**: build a target-language slice.
- **Deliver**: Language Pack (glossary, register map, motif equivalence, idiom strategy, localized
  surfaces, coverage %, open issues).
- **Hand-off**: Binder; Style (register); PN (gate phrasing).

### Binding Run

- **Goal**: assemble a **player-safe export** from a **Cold snapshot**.
- **Deliver**: bundle (MD/HTML/EPUB/PDF) + front matter (snapshot/options) + View Log.
- **Hand-off**: PN for a **Narration Dry-Run**.

### Narration Dry-Run

- **Goal**: PN plays the view in-voice to spot UX issues.
- **Deliver**: PN playtest notes tagged (`choice-ambiguity`, `gate-friction`, `nav-bug`, etc.).
- **Hand-off**: Style/Codex/Binder; very rarely Story Spark if topology truly at fault.

## Guardrails that apply to every loop

- **Hot vs Cold**: work in Hot; merge to Cold only after **Gatekeeper** passes **Quality Bars**.
- **Player surfaces**: follow **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md** and **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md**.
- **Traceability**: each loop run sits inside a **Trace Unit (TU)**; record inputs/outputs and bar
  pressure.
- **Dormancy**: Showrunner decides whether Researcher/Art/Audio/Translator are awake; plan-only
  merges as **deferred** are allowed.

---

## Typical micro-routes (copy & run)

- **Story slice** → Spark → Harvest → Lore → Codex → Gatecheck → Merge → Bind → PN
- **Style fix** → Style Tune-up → Owners edit → Gatecheck → Merge
- **Art plan-only** → Art Touch-up (plan) → Gatecheck → Merge (deferred:art) → Bind
- **Translation slice** → Translation Pass → Gatecheck → Merge → Bind (coverage flagged)

**TL;DR**  
Pick one loop, do one job, hand it off. Small, clean passes beat grand gestures.
