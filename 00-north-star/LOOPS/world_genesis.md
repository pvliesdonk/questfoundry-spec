# World Genesis — Canon-First Worldbuilding

**Purpose**
Build deep, coherent worldbuilding **before** plot design. Lore Weaver proactively creates canon packs for geography, magic/metaphysics, history, factions, and culture. Story Spark then unfolds within this rich, pre-built canon foundation. Ideal for epic fantasy, sprawling sci-fi, or any project where extensive world rules precede narrative.

**Outcome**
Stabilized canon packs in **Cold** covering scoped worldbuilding themes, player-safe codex baseline, style anchors for world voice, timeline foundation, and constraint manifest for Plotwright. Story development proceeds within established canon rules.

---

## 1) Triggers (Showrunner)

- At project start, **before** first Story Spark.
- User explicitly requests canon-first approach (e.g., epic fantasy, deep sci-fi).
- Worldbuilding scope defined (geography, magic, history, factions, etc.).

**Activation**
Showrunner opens a **Trace Unit (TU)**: `TU-<date>-LW-WorldGenesis` and confirms:
- **Worldbuilding themes** to cover (geography, magic, history, factions, metaphysics, culture).
- **Worldbuilding budget** (minimal / standard / epic — see §4.1).
- Which optional roles are active (Researcher, Style Lead).

---

## 2) Inputs

- **Project concept** (genre, setting, scope).
- **Worldbuilding scope** (user-defined themes: geography, magic, history, factions, etc.).
- **Style preferences** (narrative voice, register, motifs).
- **Research constraints** (if Researcher active: real-world inspirations to corroborate).

---

## 3) Roles & Responsibilities

- **Lore Weaver (R)**
  - **Proactive canon creation** (not reactive to hooks).
  - Draft canon packs for each scoped theme:
    - Geography (regions, landmarks, trade routes)
    - Magic/Metaphysics (rules, constraints, sources)
    - History (timeline, wars, dynasties)
    - Factions (houses, guilds, temples, structure)
    - Culture (customs, technology, language notes)
  - Define invariants & constraints for each theme.
  - Build timeline foundation (T0 = ancient past, T1 = recent history, T2 = story "now").
  - Create knowledge ledger (who knows what about the world).
- **Codex Curator (C)**
  - Create player-safe codex baseline for world elements:
    - Geography entries (kingdoms, landmarks)
    - Magic/Faction entries (schools, houses)
    - Historical entries (wars, dynasties)
  - Build taxonomy (category structure for codex).
  - Cross-link entries.
- **Researcher (C, optional)**
  - If active: corroborate real-world inspirations (e.g., medieval siege tactics, trade routes).
  - Attach citations to factual canon.
  - If dormant: mark `uncorroborated:<risk>`.
- **Style Lead (C)**
  - Define world voice/register:
    - Narrative voice (formal? colloquial? archaic?)
    - Dialogue patterns (nobility vs. commoners)
    - Motifs (recurring imagery: fire/ice, light/shadow)
  - Create style addendum for Scene Smith to use later.
- **Gatekeeper (C)**
  - Preview validation:
    - **Integrity** — All entity references resolve within genesis canon.
    - **Style** — Voice/register consistent across genesis.
    - **Presentation** — Codex baseline is player-safe.
  - Note: Reachability/Nonlinearity don't apply yet (no plot).
- **Showrunner (A)**
  - Scopes worldbuilding themes and budget.
  - Triggers loop iteration if Gatekeeper blocks.
  - Approves merge to Cold after stabilization.

## 4) Procedure

### 4.1 Frame the World (Lore Weaver + Showrunner)

Define worldbuilding scope and budget:

**Worldbuilding Budget:**

**Minimal Genesis** (1-2 hours):
- 1 canon pack for magic/metaphysics
- 1 canon pack for geography
- 5-10 codex entries
- 1 style addendum
- Timeline with 3-5 anchors

**Standard Genesis** (4-8 hours):
- 3-5 canon packs (magic, geography, factions, history, metaphysics)
- 20-30 codex entries
- 1 style addendum
- Timeline with 5-10 anchors

**Epic Genesis** (20+ hours):
- 10+ canon packs (detailed magic system, 12 kingdoms, 500-year timeline, 8 factions, metaphysics, technology, culture)
- 100+ codex entries
- Multiple style addenda (per region/faction voice)
- Extensive timeline (50+ anchors)

**Scoping Questions:**
- How many regions/kingdoms/biomes?
- How far back does history go?
- Magic/metaphysics depth (simple rules or complex systems)?
- How many major factions (houses, guilds, empires)?
- Cultural detail (customs, language, technology level)?

**Output:** Worldbuilding scope document listing themes to cover.

---

### 4.2 Proactive Canon Creation (Lore Weaver)

For each scoped theme, Lore Weaver drafts canon packs **proactively** (no hooks required):

#### Geography Canon

**Canon questions:**
- How many regions/kingdoms/continents?
- Major landmarks (mountains, rivers, cities, ruins)?
- Trade routes and travel times?
- Climate zones and seasonal constraints?

**Canon pack structure:**
- **Canon Answers (Hot)** — Spoiler-level geography details.
- **Timeline Anchors** — When regions were settled/conquered.
- **Invariants** — "The Ironwood Forest is impassable in winter."
- **Entity/State Deltas** — Regional boundaries over time.
- **Knowledge Ledger** — Who knows secret routes, hidden landmarks.
- **Player-Safe Summaries (Cold)** — "The Ironwood Forest spans 200 leagues..."

#### Magic/Metaphysics Canon

**Canon questions:**
- What are magic rules (sources, limits, costs)?
- Who can use magic (bloodlines, training, divine favor)?
- What are metaphysics (gods, afterlife, prophecy mechanics)?
- What are constraints (cannot resurrect dead, magic fades over distance)?

**Canon pack structure:**
- **Canon Answers (Hot)** — Spoiler-level magic mechanics.
- **Invariants** — "Magic cannot resurrect the dead; souls pass beyond recall."
- **Constraints** — "Ley lines concentrate magic; disruption causes unpredictable effects."
- **Knowledge Ledger** — Who knows advanced techniques, forbidden spells.
- **Player-Safe Summaries (Cold)** — "Mages draw power from ley lines..."

#### History Canon

**Canon questions:**
- How far back does timeline go (50 years? 500 years? 5000 years)?
- Major events (wars, dynasties, cataclysms)?
- How do past events constrain present (old treaties, blood feuds, prophecies)?

**Canon pack structure:**
- **Timeline Anchors (Hot)** — T0 (ancient past), T1 (recent history), T2 (story "now").
- **Canon Answers** — Spoiler-level historical causality.
- **Invariants** — "The Blood Compact of Y-300 binds all signatories; breaking it triggers war."
- **Entity/State Deltas** — How kingdoms rose/fell.
- **Player-Safe Summaries (Cold)** — "The Three Kingdoms War reshaped borders in Y-150..."

#### Faction Canon

**Canon questions:**
- How many major factions (political houses, guilds, temples, empires)?
- What are faction structures (hierarchy, membership, goals)?
- How do factions relate (alliances, rivalries, neutrals)?
- What are faction powers (economic, military, magical)?

**Canon pack structure:**
- **Canon Answers (Hot)** — Spoiler-level faction motives, secrets.
- **Invariants** — "House Vaelen controls northern trade routes; challenging them triggers embargo."
- **Entity/State Deltas** — Faction influence over time.
- **Knowledge Ledger** — Who knows faction secrets, hidden agendas.
- **Player-Safe Summaries (Cold)** — "House Vaelen is known for shrewd trade and winter resilience..."

#### Culture/Technology Canon (optional)

**Canon questions:**
- What is technology baseline (medieval, steampunk, space-faring)?
- What are customs (formal greetings, dining etiquette, religious practices)?
- What are language notes (dialects, idioms, formality levels)?

**Canon pack structure:**
- **Canon Answers (Hot)** — Spoiler-level cultural rules.
- **Invariants** — "Nobles use formal register; commoners use colloquial."
- **Player-Safe Summaries (Cold)** — "Greeting a noble requires a bow and formal address..."

---

### 4.3 Factual Grounding (Researcher, if active)

For real-world inspirations:
- Medieval siege tactics → research corroborates plausibility.
- Renaissance trade routes → attach citations.
- If dormant: mark `uncorroborated:<risk>`.

---

### 4.4 Codex Baseline (Codex Curator)

Create player-safe codex entries for world elements:

**Geography entries:**
- "The Ironwood Forest" — "Spans 200 leagues north of the capital; impassable in winter."
- "The Shattered Isles" — "Archipelago of volcanic remnants; treacherous currents."

**Magic entries:**
- "Ley Lines" — "Invisible conduits of magical energy; mapped by ancient scholars."
- "The Five Schools" — "Elemental, Divine, Shadow, Rune, and Mind magic."

**Faction entries:**
- "House Vaelen" — "Northern trade lords; known for shrewd negotiations and winter hardiness."
- "The Guild of Chandlers" — "Controls candle and light trade; politically neutral."

**Historical entries:**
- "The Three Kingdoms War" — "Y-150 conflict that reshaped borders; uneasy peace remains."
- "The Blood Compact" — "Y-300 treaty binding signatories; breaking it triggers war."

**Taxonomy (category structure):**
- Geography → Regions → Kingdoms, Landmarks, Trade Routes
- Magic → Schools, Artifacts, Phenomena
- Factions → Houses, Guilds, Temples
- History → Wars, Treaties, Dynasties

**Cross-link entries:**
- "House Vaelen" ↔ "Northern Trade Routes"
- "Ley Lines" ↔ "The Five Schools"

---

### 4.5 Style Anchors (Style Lead)

Define world voice/register:

**Narrative voice:**
- Formal? "The kingdom's borders had been drawn in blood and sealed with oaths."
- Colloquial? "The kingdom's lines were carved out with swords and promises."
- Archaic? "Thus were the realm's bounds set forth, wrought in crimson and sworn upon."

**Dialogue patterns:**
- **Nobility:** Formal register, third-person references ("House Vaelen presents its regards").
- **Commoners:** Colloquial, contractions ("Vaelen's lot are tough traders, they are").
- **Priests:** Liturgical, solemn ("The gods witness our covenant").

**Motifs:**
- Fire/Ice (passion vs. reason)
- Light/Shadow (truth vs. deception)
- Steel/Silk (force vs. diplomacy)

**Style addendum:** Created for Scene Smith to use during Story Spark.

---

### 4.6 Gatekeeper Preview

Early validation:
- **Integrity** — All entity references resolve (e.g., "House Vaelen controls northern routes" → "northern routes" defined in geography canon).
- **Style** — Voice/register consistent across genesis canon.
- **Presentation** — Codex baseline is player-safe (no spoilers).

**Note:** Reachability/Nonlinearity don't apply (no plot yet).

**If blocked:**
- Gatekeeper identifies issues (e.g., "Geography canon contradicts magic canon — ley lines don't align with regions").
- Showrunner triggers iteration (revise relevant canon pack).

---

### 4.7 Stabilization

Loop iterates until:
- All scoped themes covered.
- No internal contradictions.
- Codex baseline complete.
- Gatekeeper approves (Integrity + Style + Presentation).

**Example iteration (see §11):**

---

## 5) Deliverables (Hot → Cold after gatecheck)

- **Canon Packs** (one per theme: geography, magic, history, factions, culture)
  - Status: `cold-merged` (immutable baseline for story)
- **Codex Baseline** (player-safe entries for world elements)
  - Status: `cold-merged`
- **Style Addendum** (world voice/register)
  - Status: `cold-merged`
- **Timeline Foundation** (T0/T1/T2 anchors)
- **Constraint Manifest** (rules for Plotwright)
  - "Magic cannot resurrect the dead."
  - "House Vaelen controls northern trade routes."
  - "The Ironwood Forest is impassable in winter."
- **Entity Registry** (characters, places, factions defined in genesis)
- **TU** (`TU-<date>-LW-WorldGenesis`)
- **Gatekeeper Report** (validation summary)

---

## 6) Merge Path (summary)

World Genesis operates in **Hot** during drafting. After Gatekeeper approval:
- All genesis canon merges to **Cold** (immutable baseline).
- Story Spark proceeds within these constraints.

---

## 7) Success Criteria

- All scoped worldbuilding themes have canon packs.
- No internal contradictions in genesis canon.
- Codex baseline covers world fundamentals.
- Style addendum sets voice/register.
- Timeline foundation (T0/T1/T2) is clear.
- Constraint manifest is actionable for Plotwright.
- Gatekeeper approves (Integrity + Style + Presentation).
- Story Spark can design topology using genesis canon.

---

## 8) Failure Modes & Remedies

- **Canon sprawl** (too much worldbuilding; delays story) → Set budget; defer non-critical themes to "extend during Lore Deepening."
- **Internal contradictions** (geography conflicts with magic) → Lore Weaver revises; Gatekeeper blocks until resolved.
- **Codex spoilers** → Codex Curator revises to player-safe summary.
- **Style drift** → Style Lead flags inconsistencies; Lore Weaver harmonizes.
- **Over-building** (unused canon) → Heuristic: Stop when Plotwright's likely questions are answerable.

## 9) RACI (quick)

| Task                  | R           | A          | C                 | I    |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ---- |
| Frame world scope     | Lore Weaver | Showrunner | Style             | Plot |
| Draft genesis canon   | Lore Weaver | Showrunner | Researcher, Style | —    |
| Factual grounding     | Researcher  | Showrunner | Lore              | —    |
| Codex baseline        | Curator     | Lore       | Style             | —    |
| Style anchors         | Style Lead  | Showrunner | Lore              | SS   |
| Gatekeeper preview    | Gatekeeper  | Showrunner | Lore              | All  |
| Stabilization trigger | Showrunner  | Showrunner | Lore, Gatekeeper  | All  |
| Merge to Cold         | Lore Weaver | Showrunner | Gatekeeper        | All  |

---

## 10) Hand-offs

- **To Story Spark**: Constraint manifest, timeline foundation, entity registry, style addendum.
- **To Lore Deepening**: Hooks from Story Spark can **extend** genesis canon (not contradict).
- **To Codex Expansion**: Gap list (plot-specific entries needed after Story Spark).

- History: 500-year timeline, 3 major wars, dynasties
- Factions: 8 great houses, 3 temples, 2 guilds
- Metaphysics: Gods, afterlife, prophecy mechanics, soul magic
- Culture: Nobility etiquette, commoner dialects, religious customs

Duration: 22h 15m (2 iterations)
TU: TU-2025-11-10-LW-WorldGenesis

Artifacts Created:
  ✓ Geography Canon (12 kingdoms, ley line network, trade routes)
  ✓ Magic Canon (5 schools, ley mechanics, divine/arcane split)
  ✓ History Canon (500-year timeline, 3 wars, 8 dynasties)
  ✓ Faction Canon (8 houses, 3 temples, 2 guilds)
  ✓ Metaphysics Canon (gods, afterlife, prophecy, soul magic)
  ✓ Codex Baseline (100+ entries)
  ✓ Style Addendum (formal narrative, noble/commoner patterns)
  ✓ Timeline Foundation (T0-T2)
  ✓ Constraint Manifest (25 invariants for Plotwright)

Next suggested loop: Story Spark
```

**Constraint Manifest (sample):**

**Invariants (Plotwright cannot change):**
- Magic cannot resurrect the dead; souls pass beyond recall.
- Ley lines concentrate magic; disruption causes unpredictable effects.
- House Vaelen controls northern trade routes (economic gate).
- The Blood Compact of Y-300 binds all signatories; breaking triggers war.
- The Ironwood Forest is impassable in winter (seasonal gate).
- The Five Schools of magic are mutually exclusive (cannot learn multiple).

**Timeline:**
- T0 = Y-500 (First Dynasty, gods descend)
- T1 = Y-150 (Three Kingdoms War, borders redrawn)
- T2 = Y+0 (Current state: uneasy peace, old treaties binding)
- T3+ = Story events (Book 1 starts at Y+0)

**Entity Registry:**
- 12 kingdoms (boundaries, capitals, rulers)
- 8 great houses (structure, influence, secrets)
- 3 temples (gods, hierarchy, rituals)
- 2 guilds (trade, neutrality)
- 5 magic schools (rules, practitioners)

**Story Spark (Book 1: "The Heir's Gambit"):**

Now Plotwright designs topology **within genesis constraints**:
- **Hubs** = Kingdom capitals (from geography canon)
- **Gateways** = House influence (from faction canon), Magic school access (from magic canon), Seasonal constraints (from geography canon)
- **Loops** = Political intrigue between houses (from faction canon), prophecy unfolding (from metaphysics canon)
- **Codewords** = Treaties (from history canon), House seals (from faction canon), Magic techniques (from magic canon)

**Story honors invariants:**
- Cannot resurrect dead (even if desired)
- Cannot break Blood Compact without war (narrative consequence)
- Cannot cross Ironwood in winter (seasonal gate)

---

**TL;DR**
Frame worldbuilding scope and budget, proactively draft canon packs for geography/magic/history/factions, create player-safe codex baseline and style anchors, iterate until contradictions resolved and Gatekeeper approves, merge to Cold as immutable foundation, then hand off to Story Spark for plot design within established canon constraints.
