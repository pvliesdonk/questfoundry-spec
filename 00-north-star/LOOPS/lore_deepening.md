# Lore Deepening — Turn Accepted Hooks into Canon

**Purpose**  
Transform **accepted hooks** into coherent, contradiction-aware **canon** (backstories, timelines, metaphysics, causal links). Keep spoilers in canon notes; publish player-safe surfaces later via **Codex Expansion**.

**Outcome**  
Canonical entries ready to merge to **Cold** (after gatecheck), with clear lineage to hooks/TUs, plus notes for Plotwright/Scene Smith when structure or prose should react.

---

## 1) Triggers (Showrunner)

- After **Hook Harvest** marks hooks as `accepted`.
- When Plotwright/Scene Smith need causal backfill to proceed.
- When contradictions surface and must be adjudicated.

**Activation**  
Showrunner opens/updates a **Trace Unit (TU)**: `tu-lore-deepening-<topic>` and confirms whether **Researcher** is active (affects factual claims).

---

## 2) Inputs

- Accepted hooks (narrative/scene/factual/taxonomy) clustered by theme.
- Current **Cold** canon/codex; relevant style guardrails.
- Topology deltas from **Story Spark** (if any).
- Research memos or `uncorroborated:<risk>` flags.

---

## 3) Roles & Responsibilities

- **Lore Weaver (R)**
  - Expand accepted hooks into **canon**: write backstory, timeline anchors, causal constraints, faction motives, metaphysics.
  - Resolve collisions; or label **deliberate mysteries** with boundaries & revisit date.
- **Researcher (C, optional)**
  - Corroborate factual claims; supply citations; downgrade/upgrade uncertainty.
- **Plotwright (C)**
  - Sanity-check topology implications; request or accept constraints on gateways/loops.
- **Scene Smith (C)**
  - Note prose adjustments suggested by new canon (tone, tells, callbacks).
- **Style Lead (C)**
  - Ensure lore tone/voice fits the setting’s register; flag motif opportunities.
- **Gatekeeper (C)**
  - Pre-reads for likely Integrity/Reachability/Gateway risk before gatecheck.
- **Showrunner (A)**
  - Scopes the deepening pass; resolves cross-domain contention.

---

## 4) Procedure

1. **Frame the Canon Question (Lore Weaver)**
   - For each theme/cluster: write a 1–3 line _canon question_ (“What caused Kestrel’s jaw scar, and who else was involved?”).

2. **Draft Canon Answer**
   - Provide a precise, spoiler-level answer: backstory, causal chain, timeline anchor(s), implicated entities/factions, constraints on technology/magic/metaphysics as needed.
   - Tag **sensitivity** (`spoiler-heavy`, `player-safe-summary-possible`).

3. **Check Contradictions & Coupling**
   - Compare against **Cold**. Identify clashes; propose reconciliations or mark **deliberate mystery** (include bounds and revisit window).

4. **Factual Pass (if Researcher active)**
   - Validate real-world claims; attach citations.
   - If dormant: keep `uncorroborated:<risk>` and note wording guidance for PN/Binder (“use neutral phrasing”).

5. **Topology & Prose Notes**
   - List any consequences for **gateways**, **loops**, **hubs**.
   - Suggest hooks for **Story Spark** if structure needs adjustment.
   - Provide Scene Smith with **callout notes** (what can be foreshadowed, recalled, or described).

6. **Style Sweep**
   - Style Lead annotates motif ties and tone consistency; no rewrite, only guidance.

7. **Package Canon Entry**
   - Each entry includes: **Title**, **Canon Answer**, **Timeline anchors**, **Entities affected**, **Constraints**, **Sensitivity tag**, **Upstream hooks/TUs**, **Downstream impacts**, **Notes**.

8. **Pre-Gate Review (Gatekeeper)**
   - Early read for risks: Integrity (referential), Reachability (if topology touched), Gateways (consistency), Presentation (spoiler segregation).

9. **Handoff**
   - Send **player-safe summaries** to **Codex Expansion**;
   - Send topology/prose notes to **Story Spark** / **Scene Smith** as needed.

---

## 5) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Canon Pack** (human text, spoiler-level), one entry per theme:
  - Title, Canon Answer, Timeline, Entities/Factions, Constraints, Sensitivity, Upstream hooks/TUs, Downstream impacts, Notes.
- **Prose Notes** for Scene Smith (foreshadow/callbacks/description updates).
- **Topology Notes** for Plotwright (gateway/loop implications).
- **Factual Appendix** (citations or `uncorroborated:<risk>` list).
- **Pre-gate note** (Gatekeeper): anticipated bar risks.

---

## 6) Merge Path (summary)

- Canon entries proceed to **Gatecheck** → if **pass**, **Showrunner** merges to **Cold**.
- Player-safe surfaces **do not** merge here; they’re produced in **Codex Expansion**.

---

## 7) Success Criteria

- Each accepted hook is either canonized, deferred with reason, or rejected with rationale.
- Canon resolves prior contradictions **or** marks **deliberate mystery** with bounds.
- Topology/prose impacts are enumerated and handed off.
- Spoilers are separated from player-safe summaries.
- Factual claims carry citations or explicit risk flags.

---

## 8) Failure Modes & Remedies

- **Canon sprawl** (too many moving parts) → Split into smaller themed entries; stage merges.
- **Hidden spoiler leak to codex** → Move detail back to canon notes; codex receives a summary.
- **Topology unacknowledged** → Route a **Story Spark** mini to adjust gateways/loops.
- **Research dormant but high-risk claims** → Keep neutral PN/Binder wording; schedule a research revisit TU.

## 10) Example (miniature)

**Title**: Kestrel’s Jaw Scar — Dock-Fire Causality  
**Canon Answer**: Eighteen years ago, a refinery valve jam sparked a flash fire on Dock 7. Kestrel shielded a junior tech, catching the brunt—left mandibular burn. The “accident” masked a sabotage test by the Toll Syndicate.  
**Timeline**: Y–18 Dock 7 Fire; Y–5 Syndicate trials; Y–0 hub tensions escalate.  
**Entities**: Kestrel Var, Toll Syndicate, Dock 7 ops, junior tech (Ena Roe).  
**Constraints**: Syndicate prefers plausibly deniable tests; Dock 7 logs are incomplete.  
**Sensitivity**: spoiler-heavy (codex gets “refinery accident; heroism rumor” only)  
**Upstream**: hooks “Kestrel’s Jaw Scar”, “Shadow Toll at Wormhole 3”  
**Downstream**: Scene callbacks in S12, S41; hub pressure at Wormhole 3; potential gateway “Syndicate Recognition”  
**Notes**: Research `uncorroborated:low` on valve model; add source later.

---

**TL;DR**  
Accept hooks, answer the real questions, stitch cause to effect, quarantine spoilers, and tell downstream roles exactly what to do next. Then gate it and freeze it into Cold.
