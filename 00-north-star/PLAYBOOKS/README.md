# Playbooks — One-Page, Do-This-Now Guides

Playbooks are **checklist-ready** summaries of the targeted loops. When you already know _what_
you’re doing and just need the **“how in one page,”** grab the matching playbook below.

> Playbooks change **Hot** and only reach **Cold** after Gatekeeper passes the Quality Bars. Keep
> **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md** and **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md** open when you run them.

## When to use playbooks vs. full loop guides

- **Playbook** = you’re executing and want **checklists, roles, deliverables, success criteria** on
  one page.
- **Full loop guide** (in `../LOOPS/`) = you’re planning or teaching the loop and want deeper
  rationale, anti-patterns, and examples.

---

## Shared guardrails (apply to every playbook)

- Work in **Hot**; merge to **Cold** only after **Gatekeeper** passes **Integrity, Reachability,
  Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism (if promised), Presentation**.
- Player surfaces obey **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md**; accessibility baselines in
  **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md**.
- Each run sits inside a **Trace Unit (TU)**; record inputs/outputs and bar pressure.
- **Dormancy policy**: Showrunner decides which optional roles wake (Researcher, Art/Audio,
  Translator); plan-only merges as **deferred** are allowed.

**TL;DR**  
Pick the right playbook, open a TU, run the checklist, hand off cleanly, and let the Gatekeeper keep
us honest.
