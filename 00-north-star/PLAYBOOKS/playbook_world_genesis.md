# Playbook — World Genesis

**Use when:** Starting a project where extensive **worldbuilding comes before plot** (epic fantasy, deep sci-fi, rich settings). You want to build canon packs for geography, magic, history, and factions proactively, then Story Spark within those constraints.

**Outcome:** Stabilized canon packs in Cold covering scoped worldbuilding themes, player-safe codex baseline, style anchors, timeline foundation, and constraint manifest for Plotwright. Ready for Story Spark.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **worldbuilding themes**: geography? magic? history? factions? metaphysics? culture?
- [ ] Set **worldbuilding budget**: minimal (1-2 hours), standard (4-8 hours), epic (20+ hours).
- [ ] Open TU: `TU-<date>-LW-WorldGenesis`.
- [ ] Confirm which optional roles are active (Researcher, Style Lead).
- [ ] Heuristic: Stop when Plotwright's likely questions are answerable.

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- **Project concept** (genre, setting, scope).
- **Worldbuilding scope** (user-defined themes).
- **Style preferences** (narrative voice, register, motifs).
- **Research constraints** (if Researcher active: real-world inspirations).

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Lore Weaver + Showrunner**

1. **Frame the world**: Define scope per theme (see §4 for scoping guidance).

**Lore Weaver (R)** — Proactive canon creation

2. **Geography canon**:
   - Regions/kingdoms/continents, landmarks, trade routes, climate zones, travel times.
   - Invariants: "The Ironwood Forest is impassable in winter."
3. **Magic/Metaphysics canon**:
   - Rules, limits, sources, who can use it, metaphysics (gods, afterlife, prophecy).
   - Invariants: "Magic cannot resurrect the dead."
4. **History canon**:
   - Timeline depth (50 years? 500 years?), major events (wars, dynasties, cataclysms).
   - Invariants: "The Blood Compact binds all signatories."
5. **Faction canon**:
   - Major powers (houses, guilds, temples, empires), structures, rivalries, goals.
   - Invariants: "House Vaelen controls northern trade routes."
6. **Culture/Technology canon** (optional):
   - Technology baseline, customs, language notes.

**Researcher (C, optional)**

7. **Factual grounding**: Corroborate real-world inspirations; attach citations or mark `uncorroborated:<risk>`.

**Codex Curator (C)**

8. **Codex baseline**:
   - Player-safe entries for world elements (geography, magic, factions, history).
   - Build taxonomy (category structure).
   - Cross-link entries.

**Style Lead (C)**

9. **Style anchors**:
   - Narrative voice (formal? colloquial? archaic?).
   - Dialogue patterns (nobility vs. commoners).
   - Motifs (fire/ice, light/shadow, steel/silk).

**Gatekeeper (C)**

10. **Preview validation**:
    - **Integrity**: All entity references resolve within genesis canon.
    - **Style**: Voice/register consistent across genesis.
    - **Presentation**: Codex baseline is player-safe.
    - Note: Reachability/Nonlinearity/Gateways don't apply yet (no plot).

**Lore Weaver**

11. **Stabilization**: Loop iterates until all themes covered, no contradictions, Gatekeeper approves.

## 4) Worldbuilding budget guidance

**Minimal Genesis (1-2 hours):**

- 1 canon pack for magic/metaphysics.
- 1 canon pack for geography.
- 5-10 codex entries.
- 1 style addendum.
- Timeline with 3-5 anchors.

**Standard Genesis (4-8 hours):**

- 3-5 canon packs (magic, geography, factions, history, metaphysics).
- 20-30 codex entries.
- 1 style addendum.
- Timeline with 5-10 anchors.

**Epic Genesis (20+ hours):**

- 10+ canon packs (detailed magic, 12 kingdoms, 500-year timeline, 8 factions, metaphysics, tech, culture).
- 100+ codex entries.
- Multiple style addenda (per region/faction voice).
- Extensive timeline (50+ anchors).

**Heuristic:** Stop when you can answer Plotwright's likely questions. Over-building risks unused canon.

---

## 5) Deliverables (Hot → Cold after gatecheck)

- **Canon packs** (one per theme).
- **Codex baseline** (player-safe entries).
- **Style addendum** (world voice/register).
- **Timeline foundation** (T0/T1/T2 anchors).
- **Constraint manifest** (rules for Plotwright: invariants, affordances, can/cannot).
- **Entity registry** (characters, places, factions, items).
- **World Genesis Manifest** (records loop execution).
- **TU** (`TU-<date>-LW-WorldGenesis`).
- **Gatekeeper report** (validation summary).

---

## 6) Handoffs

- **To Story Spark**: Constraint manifest, timeline foundation, entity registry, style addendum.
- **To Lore Deepening**: Hooks from Story Spark can **extend** genesis canon (not contradict).
- **To Codex Expansion**: Gap list (plot-specific entries needed after Story Spark).

---

## 7) Success criteria (Y/N)

- [ ] All scoped worldbuilding themes have canon packs.
- [ ] No internal contradictions in genesis canon.
- [ ] Codex baseline covers world fundamentals.
- [ ] Style addendum sets voice/register.
- [ ] Timeline foundation (T0/T1/T2) is clear.
- [ ] Constraint manifest is actionable for Plotwright.
- [ ] Gatekeeper approves (Integrity + Style + Presentation).
- [ ] Story Spark can design topology using genesis canon.

---

## 8) Escape hatches

- **Canon sprawl** (too much worldbuilding; delays story) → Set budget; defer non-critical themes to "extend during Lore Deepening."
- **Internal contradictions** (geography conflicts with magic) → Lore Weaver revises; Gatekeeper blocks until resolved.
- **Codex spoilers** → Codex Curator revises to player-safe summary.
- **Style drift** → Style Lead flags inconsistencies; Lore Weaver harmonizes.
- **Over-building** (unused canon) → Heuristic: Stop when Plotwright's likely questions are answerable.

## 9) Example constraint manifest (mini)

**Invariants (CANNOT CHANGE):**

- Geography: The Ironwood Forest is impassable in winter (seasonal gate).
- Magic: Magic cannot resurrect the dead (metaphysical constraint).
- Factions: House Vaelen controls northern trade (economic gate).

**Affordances (FOR PLOTWRIGHT):**

- 12 kingdoms = potential hubs (capitals as story locations).
- Trade routes = loops (travel with trade, encounter smugglers).
- Ley line network = magic-based gates (access to certain schools/areas).

**You CAN:**

- Use kingdom capitals as hubs (12 options).
- Create gates based on magic school access.
- Use house rivalries for political tension.

**You CANNOT:**

- Resurrect the dead (violates magic invariant).
- Change kingdom borders (violates Blood Compact).
- Cross Ironwood in winter (violates geography constraint).

---

**Typical pass:** 2-4 hours (standard genesis); 20+ hours (epic genesis).
