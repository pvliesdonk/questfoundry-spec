# Playbook — Narration Dry-Run

**Use when:** You have a **Binding Run export** and need PN to playtest it **in-world** to surface
UX issues before releasing to players.

**Outcome:** PN playtest notes (issue type + context + remedy suggestions) and follow-up TUs routed
to the right loops (Style/Codex/Binder). No content changes during the dry-run itself.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Select **same Cold snapshot** as the Binding Run.
- [ ] Plan **representative routes** (hub route, loop return, gated branch, terminal).
- [ ] Open TU: `tu-pn-dryrun-<date|milestone>` and note scope (depth, languages tested).

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- **Export bundle** from Binding Run (Markdown/HTML/EPUB/PDF).
- PN Principles (in-world, spoiler-safe, diegetic gates).
- Style guardrails (voice/register/motifs).
- Language Pack (if testing translations).

_(PN reads **Cold** only—no Hot drafts, no canon notes.)_

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**PN (R)**

1. Narrate **in-voice**; present choices clearly; perform recaps when natural.
2. Enforce gateways **diegetically** without exposing internals.
3. **Do not improvise** new content; **log issues** instead with tags:
   - `choice-ambiguity`, `gate-friction`, `recap-needed`, `codex-invite`, `leak-risk`, `nav-bug`,
     `tone-wobble`, `accessibility`

**Gatekeeper (C)** 4. Classify issues by severity and bar mapping (Presentation, Integrity, Style,
Accessibility).

**Binder (C)** 5. Verify navigation/format issues (anchors, labels, layout).

**Curator (C)** 6. Check codex links and coverage gaps.

**Style (C)** 7. Propose phrasing patterns or motif nudges (no structural edits).

**Showrunner (R)** 8. Convert notes into **TUs** or **edit tasks** routed to follow-up loops.

---

## 4) Deliverables (Hot)

- **PN Playtest Notes** — each item with: context (section/choice), issue type, suggested remedy.
- **Summary Sheet** — count by issue type/severity, recommended follow-up loops, languages tested.

_(Do not alter Cold during dry-run; changes happen in follow-up loops.)_

---

## 5) Hand-off map

- → **Style Tune-up** (tone/phrasing systems).
- → **Codex Expansion** (coverage gaps).
- → **Binding fixes** (navigation/format).
- → **Story Spark** only if topology flaw revealed (rare).

---

## 6) Definition of "done" (for this loop)

- [ ] Gates enforced **diegetically** without confusion or leaks.
- [ ] Choices read as **distinct and fair**; recaps land where helpful.
- [ ] Codex invites clarify, not spoil.
- [ ] Navigation smooth across all export formats.
- [ ] Small, prioritized list of **actionable** follow-ups created.
- [ ] No improvised fixes during dry-run; all issues properly logged.

---

## 7) Fast triage rubric (Showrunner)

- **Advance now**: minor issues with clear fixes; route to Style/Codex/Binder.
- **Defer**: non-critical UX polish; schedule for next iteration.
- **Block**: gates leak plumbing, major nav bugs, spoilers visible — needs immediate Style/Binder
  fix.
