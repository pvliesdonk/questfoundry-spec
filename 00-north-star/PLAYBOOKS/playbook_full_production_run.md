# Playbook — Full Production Run

**Use when:** You need an **end-to-end pass** from ideation to exported view, exercising all core
loops in sequence. (Prefer targeted loops for most work; use this for comprehensive milestones.)

**Outcome:** Exported view on Cold with all core loops exercised: topology, canon, codex, style,
optional assets, gatecheck, and binding. Stamped with Cold snapshot ID.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **target** (chapter/act/booklet) and **constraints** (tone, content limits).
- [ ] Mark roles **active/dormant** (Researcher, Art/Audio, Translator).
- [ ] Open TU: `tu-full-production-<milestone>` and note risk register (dormant roles, plan-only
      items).

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- Project brief; target scope and constraints.
- Style Lead's current guardrails.
- Existing Cold canon/codex for continuity.
- Role activation list and loop plan (what's in/out).

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Story Spark (Plotwright R, Scene Smith R, Style Lead C)**

1. Draft/update topology: hubs, loops, gateways, codewords.
2. Draft key sections aligned to style.
3. Generate narrative/scene hooks.
4. Gatekeeper preview: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity.

**Hook Harvest (Showrunner R)** 5. Triage hooks: `quick-win`, `needs-research`, `structure-impact`,
`deferred`.

**Lore Deepening (Lore Weaver R)** 6. Convert accepted hooks into canon: backstories, timelines,
metaphysics. 7. Coordinate with Plotwright if topology must adjust.

**Codex Expansion (Codex Curator R)** 8. Publish player-safe entries from new canon. 9. Add
cross-refs; keep spoilers in canon notes.

**Style Tune-up (Style Lead R)** 10. Correct tone/voice drift; refine motifs. 11. Align captions/PN
surfaces to current register.

**Optional: Art/Audio (if active)** 12. Art Director plans scenes; Illustrator produces assets (or
deferred). 13. Audio Director plans cues; Audio Producer creates assets (or deferred).

**Stabilization & Gatecheck (Gatekeeper R)** 14. Cross-role review; resolve contradictions. 15. Run
all Quality Bars; produce gatecheck note (pass/fail + remediation).

**Merge Hot → Cold (Showrunner R)** 16. On pass, merge canon, codex, plans/assets to Cold. 17. Stamp
Cold snapshot ID.

**Binding Run (Book Binder R)** 18. Assemble export view from Cold snapshot. 19. Ensure
accessibility and spoiler hygiene. 20. Record snapshot ID and options in front matter.

**Narration Dry-Run (PN R, optional)** 21. Playtest exported bundle in-world. 22. Log UX issues for
follow-up loops.

---

## 4) Deliverables (Cold + Archive)

- **Cold snapshot** with merged canon, codex, style, plans/assets.
- **Export bundle** (Markdown/HTML/EPUB/PDF) with front matter and View Log.
- **Gatecheck note** (pass/fail + bar statuses).
- **PN playtest notes** (if Narration Dry-Run included).
- **TU closure** with snapshot ID and handoff notes.

---

## 5) Hand-off map

- → **Archive** (Cold snapshot + export preserved).
- → **Distribution** (release, review, playtest).
- → **Follow-up loops** (if PN playtest surfaced issues).

---

## 6) Definition of "done" (for this loop)

- [ ] Topology complete with meaningful hubs/loops/gateways.
- [ ] Canon deepened; codex published player-safe.
- [ ] Style aligned; captions/PN surfaces in-register.
- [ ] Optional assets planned or produced (or deferred).
- [ ] All Quality Bars passed (Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism,
      Presentation, Accessibility).
- [ ] Hot merged to Cold with snapshot ID.
- [ ] Export bundle assembled, stamped, and ready for distribution.
- [ ] PN dry-run completed (if included) with follow-up items routed.

---

## 7) Fast triage rubric (Showrunner)

- **Advance now**: milestone critical; all core roles available; gatecheck passed.
- **Defer**: waiting for dormant roles; prefer targeted loops for partial work.
- **Break down**: scope too large; split into targeted loops (Story Spark → Hook Harvest → Lore →
  Codex → Style → Binding).
