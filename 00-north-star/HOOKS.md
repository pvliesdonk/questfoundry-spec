# Hooks — Fast Ideas, Safe Canon

A **hook** is a newly introduced fact, entity, affordance, or question that _might_ become canon.
Hooks keep creativity fast while protecting coherence: they are usable immediately in **Hot SoT**,
but only become **canon** after stabilization and Gatekeeper checks.

---

## 1) What qualifies as a hook?

Examples (non-exhaustive):

- **Narrative**: “New character: _Kestrel Var_,” “Hidden gateway under Dock 7,” “Loop: return here
  if `CODEWORD: ASH`.”
- **Scene detail**: “Kestrel has a burn-scar on the jaw,” “Air tastes metallic in Section 42.”
- **Factual (real-world)**: “Zero-G arterial bleeding forms floating filaments; needs cleanup
  protocol,” “Neutron star orbit period makes a 27-minute window plausible.”
- **Taxonomy/clarity**: “Codex needs an entry for _Dock 7_,” “Missing timeline anchor between
  _Incident A_ and _Election B_.”

> Hooks are small on purpose: **one idea, one rationale**. Big changes are made of many small hooks.

---

## 2) Who can generate hooks?

- **Plotwright** — narrative hooks (entities, locations, stakes, topology ideas).
- **Scene Smith** — concrete scene-level hooks (traits, tells, props, micro-events).
- **Researcher** — factual hooks (claims to verify, constraints, contradictions; with
  sources/uncertainty).
- **Codex Curator** — **taxonomy/clarity hooks only** (coverage gaps, cross-ref needs, red-links).
- **Lore Weaver** — may originate narrative hooks when **backfilling** causality or resolving
  contradictions; also adjudicates accepted hooks into canon.

---

## 3) Minimal hook record (human-level, not a schema)

Each hook note must include:

- **Title** — short, unique.
- **Type** —
  `narrative | scene | factual | taxonomy | structure | canon | research | style/pn | translation | art | audio | binder/nav | accessibility`.
- **Proposed by** — role + person/agent.
- **Rationale** — why this helps (1–2 sentences).
- **Evidence** _(factual/research only)_ — citation or `uncorroborated:<risk-level>`
  (low/medium/high).
- **Upstream refs** — what inspired this (section/brief/lore page).
- **Potential impacts** — who/what might change downstream.
- **Status** — `proposed | accepted | in-progress | resolved | canonized | deferred | rejected`.
- **Notes** — optional: `deliberate-mystery`, `spoiler`, `accessibility`, etc.

> Keep it lightweight. This is a card you can sort, not a contract.

## 4) Lifecycle & loops

1. **Create (Hot SoT)** — any generator writes a hook card with status `proposed`.
2. **Hook Harvest (loop)** — Showrunner triggers; cluster similar hooks, remove dupes, set **triage
   tags**:
   - `quick-win` (low risk, clear value)
   - `needs-research` (Researcher active or mark_uncorroborated)
   - `structure-impact` (affects topology/gateways)
   - `style-impact` (tone/voice/aesthetic ramifications)
3. **Decision** — Mark hooks as `accepted` (proceed), `deferred` (parked for later), or `rejected`
   (won't do, with reason).
4. **Work (in-progress)** — Accepted hooks move to `in-progress` when actively being developed.
5. **Lore Deepening (loop)** — Lore Weaver turns `in-progress` or `accepted` hooks into **canon**
   (causal backstory, timelines, metaphysics). Conflicts are either `resolved` or tagged
   `deliberate-mystery`.
6. **Codex Expansion (loop)** — Codex Curator publishes **player-safe** entries/cross-refs. Spoilers
   stay in canon notes, not in the codex.
7. **Gatekeeper checks** — Quality bars (integrity, reachability, nonlinearity, gateways, style,
   determinism, presentation, accessibility); merge **Hot → Cold** on green.
8. **Canonized** — Hook status becomes `canonized`; card links to its Cold location.

## 5) Prioritization heuristics (triage)

Prefer hooks that:

- Reduce **contradictions** or unlock blocked work.
- Strengthen **nonlinearity** meaningfully (a hub/loop/gateway that matters).
- Improve **player comprehension** (clear affordances, better signposting).
- Carry **low coupling** (wide benefit, narrow risk).
- Have **evidence** (for factual hooks), or a bounded `uncorroborated` risk.

Defer hooks that:

- Require dormant roles without Showrunner activation.
- Would create style drift or topology churn without clear benefit.
- Depend on external verification that isn’t time-boxed.

---

## 6) Acceptance criteria (before canon)

A hook can move from `accepted` → `canonized` if:

- **Clarity** — it is stated unambiguously (one idea).
- **Consistency** — does not contradict existing **Cold** canon or, if it does, comes with a
  resolution strategy signed by Lore Weaver.
- **Traceability** — has upstream refs and expected downstream impacts.
- **QA preview** — Gatekeeper can simulate impacts on integrity/reachability/nonlinearity.
- **Player safety** — if it changes visible surface (codex/manuscript), PN/codex presentation
  remains spoiler-safe.

---

## 7) Research dormancy & factual risk

When **Researcher** is dormant:

- Factual hooks must be marked `uncorroborated:<risk-level>`.
- Showrunner may still accept and canonize if the risk is **explicitly** acknowledged.
- Create a follow-up to revisit when Researcher is re-activated.

---

## 8) Conflict patterns & resolutions

- **Duplicate hooks** — Cluster under one title; preserve provenance.
- **Colliding hooks** — Lore Weaver proposes a unifying canon or declares a `deliberate-mystery`
  with boundaries.
- **Scope creep via codex** — Curator _does not_ invent deep lore; escalates narrative implications
  to Lore Weaver.
- **Hidden spoilers** — Curator publishes player-safe summaries; spoiler detail remains in canon
  notes.

---

## 9) Good hook hygiene (checklist)

- One idea per card; 8–12 lines max.
- Name it like a headline: "Kestrel's Jaw Scar ⇒ Dock-Fire Backstory Candidate."
- Tag **type** correctly; add `structure-impact` if it touches gateways/loops.
- Add at least one **upstream** reference (section ID, plot brief, research memo).
- Write a **rationale** that mentions player value ("adds motive for Act II reveal").
- For factual/research: include a **citation** or `uncorroborated:medium`.
- Suggest **next loop** (e.g., "Lore Deepening" or "Style Tune-up").

## 10) Examples

**Narrative hook**

- _Title_: “Shadow Toll at Wormhole 3”
- _Type_: narrative
- _Proposed by_: Plotwright
- _Rationale_: Introduces recurring pressure + hub economy; motivates faction conflicts.
- _Upstream refs_: Topology v2 draft, Faction notes
- _Impacts_: Scene Smith (Act I–III beats), Gateways plan, Codex entry “Wormhole Tolls”
- _Status_: proposed

**Scene hook**

- _Title_: “Kestrel’s Jaw Scar (Visible in Dock Light)”
- _Type_: scene
- _Proposed by_: Scene Smith
- _Rationale_: Visual recall anchor; foreshadows Act II backstory.
- _Upstream refs_: Section 12 draft
- _Impacts_: Lore backstory, Art portrait, Style note on descriptors
- _Status_: proposed

**Factual hook**

- _Title_: “Zero-G Blood Filaments”
- _Type_: factual
- _Proposed by_: Researcher
- _Rationale_: Grounds the medbay scene; informs cleanup constraints.
- _Evidence_: NASA microgravity medical paper (citation), alternate source TBD
- _Upstream refs_: Section 34 draft
- _Impacts_: Scene rewrite note, PN safety wording
- _Status_: proposed

**Taxonomy hook**

- _Title_: “Codex: Dock 7 (Ops/Access/Incidents)”
- _Type_: taxonomy
- _Proposed by_: Codex Curator
- _Rationale_: Player needs a single page to understand Dock 7 references; link incidents.
- _Upstream refs_: Sections 5, 12, 28; Wormhole 3 toll hook
- _Impacts_: Cross-refs to characters, timeline anchor request
- _Status_: proposed

---

## 11) Governance quick rules

- **Showrunner**: triggers **Hook Harvest**; sets triage cadence; decides activation of dormant
  roles needed to advance a hook.
- **Lore Weaver**: owns **Lore Deepening**; is final creative authority on canonization (subject to
  Gatekeeper/Showrunner gates).
- **Gatekeeper**: blocks promotion if any quality bar fails; records remediation notes.
- **Codex Curator**: publishes only after canonization; keeps the surface spoiler-safe.

---

## 12) Anti-patterns

- Turning the codex into a writer’s room (deep lore invented there).
- Multi-paragraph “hooks” that hide multiple changes.
- Canonizing on style enthusiasm alone without topology/QA review.
- Treating `uncorroborated:high` as harmless; it must be deliberate and traceable.

---

**TL;DR**  
Hooks keep us nimble without wrecking canon. Generate freely, harvest regularly, deepen
deliberately, and ship player-safe surfaces once Gatekeeper and Showrunner green-light the merge to
Cold.
