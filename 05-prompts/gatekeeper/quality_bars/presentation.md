# Quality Bar — Presentation

STATUS: SCAFFOLD TODO: Flesh out full guidance, examples, and acceptance criteria.

Checks

- Manuscript/codex/PN contain zero spoilers or internal labels.
- In-world language only; no technique talk on player surfaces.

Evidence

- Quote offending lines and suggested safe rewrites.

Common Failures

- Spoilers in codex; PN leaks codewords/state; internal labels visible; meta choices.

Remediation

- Move spoilers into canon notes; rephrase PN lines diegetically; rename internals; rewrite choices.
