# Quality Bar — Nonlinearity


Checks

- Planned hubs/loops/gateways exist and change outcomes on revisit.

Evidence

- Diagram or enumerate branches and return-with-difference examples.

Common Failures

- Cosmetic loops; thin hubs; no meaningful change on revisit.

Remediation

- Add state effects; diversify outcomes; merge trivial hubs.
