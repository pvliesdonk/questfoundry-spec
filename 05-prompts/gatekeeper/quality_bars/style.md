# Quality Bar — Style

STATUS: SCAFFOLD TODO: Flesh out full guidance, examples, and acceptance criteria.

Checks

- Voice/register/motifs align with style guide and register_map.
- PN phrasing matches agreed register.

Evidence

- Read triads of sections; list specific sentences with drift.

Common Failures

- Tone wobble; over-exposition on player surfaces; inconsistent captions.

Remediation

- Run Style Tune-up; move detail to codex or canon notes; provide phrasing fixes.
