# Quality Bar — Determinism

STATUS: SCAFFOLD TODO: Flesh out full guidance, examples, and acceptance criteria.

Checks

- When determinism promised: seeds, model/version, aspect, chain recorded sufficient to reproduce.
- Plan-only items marked deferred with constraints reviewed.

Evidence

- Parameter logs per asset; noting provider specifics.

Common Failures

- Missing seeds/versions; plan contradicts style; inconsistent parameters across set.

Remediation

- Regenerate with logging; adjust constraints with Style Lead; document non-deterministic
  exceptions.
