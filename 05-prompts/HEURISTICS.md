# Prompt Quality Heuristics

Use this scaffold for every prompt:
- **Context** — relevant background and constraints.
- **Goal** — the specific, testable outcome.
- **Constraints** — style, budgets, limits, policy.
- **Inputs** — what the agent receives (files, state paths).
- **Outputs** — exact file(s) produced and their schemas.
- **Failure Policy** — when to stop, escalate, or back off.
