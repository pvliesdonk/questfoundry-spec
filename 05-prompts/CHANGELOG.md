# Changelog — Layer 5 Prompts

All notable changes to Layer 5 prompts will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added

#### Schema Validation Enforcement (Complete Implementation)

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Schema validation is now **mandatory** for all JSON artifacts. Agents producing
artifacts without validation will be blocked at merge.

**Motivation:** Post-mortem analysis revealed that agents consistently failed to validate artifacts
despite schemas being available. Root cause: Document existence ≠ agent compliance. Solution:
Three-layer enforcement with file ordering and hard gates.

---

#### Phase 1: Validation Contract & Schema Index

**Validation Contract** (`_shared/validation_contract.md`)

- **Purpose:** Non-negotiable validation requirements for all roles
- **Position:** File #1 in all upload kits (LLMs read files sequentially)
- **Content:**
  - Preflight protocol (mandatory before producing artifacts)
  - Hard gate enforcement (validation failures STOP workflow)
  - Schema discovery via SCHEMA_INDEX.json
  - Integrity verification (SHA-256 checksums)
  - validation_report.json format specification
  - Role-specific schema mappings
  - Troubleshooting guide

**Schema Index** (`SCHEMA_INDEX.json`)

- **Purpose:** Canonical registry of all 26 Layer 3 schemas
- **Position:** File #2 in all upload kits
- **Content:** For each schema:
  - `$id` - Canonical URL for `"$schema"` field
  - `path` - Relative path to schema file
  - `draft` - JSON Schema draft version (2020-12)
  - `sha256` - Integrity checksum
  - `roles` - Roles that produce this artifact type
  - `intent` - Protocol intents that use this schema

**Index Generator** (`spec-tools/src/.../generate_schema_index.py`)

- Automated SCHEMA_INDEX.json generation
- Computes SHA-256 hashes for all schemas
- Extracts metadata from schema files
- Maps schemas to roles and protocol intents
- CLI command: `qfspec-generate-schema-index`
- Added to pyproject.toml

**Upload Kit Updates:**

- All 14 manifests updated to place validation files first
- `upload_kits.py` updated to preserve manifest order in zips
- File ordering enforced: validation_contract.md → SCHEMA_INDEX.json → other files
- Orchestration kits: 36 → 38 files
- Full standalone: 23 → 25 files
- Minimal standalone: 10 → 12 files
- All Gemini kits maintained 10-file limit (removed human_interaction.md where needed)

---

#### Phase 2: Role Prompt Validation Sections

**All 15 role system_prompts updated** with "Output Validation (Required)" section:

**Roles with explicit schema mappings (6):**

- **Plotwright** → hook_card
- **Showrunner** → hot_manifest, project_metadata
  - Added orchestration responsibility: verify all roles produce validation_report.json
- **Gatekeeper** → gatecheck_report
  - Added gate integrity note: invalid reports undermine quality enforcement
- **Book Binder** → cold_book, cold_manifest
- **Codex Curator** → codex_entry
- **Illustrator** → cold_art_manifest

**Roles with generic validation (9):**

- Scene Smith, Style Lead, Lore Weaver, Player Narrator
- Art Director, Audio Director, Audio Producer
- Translator, Researcher
- Instructed to check SCHEMA_INDEX.json for their schemas

**Each validation section includes:**

1. Reference to validation_contract.md (file #1)
2. 6-step preflight/validation protocol
3. Schema discovery instructions
4. Hard gate enforcement (STOP on failure)
5. validation_report.json format
6. Role-specific schema listings (where applicable)
7. Validation workflow example

---

#### Phase 3: Loop Playbook Validation Checkpoints

**All 13 loop playbooks updated** with "Validation Requirements (All Artifacts)" section:

**Updated playbooks:**

- archive_snapshot, art_touch_up, audio_pass, binding_run
- codex_expansion, gatecheck, hook_harvest, lore_deepening
- narration_dry_run, post_mortem, story_spark, style_tune_up
- translation_pass

**Each validation section specifies:**

1. Reference to validation_contract.md
2. 7-step validation protocol for artifact-producing steps:
   - Producer looks up schema in SCHEMA_INDEX.json
   - Producer runs preflight protocol
   - Producer validates and emits validation_report.json
   - **If validation fails: STOP loop, escalate to Showrunner**
   - Showrunner verifies both files exist before handoff
   - Showrunner checks `"valid": true` in validation_report.json
   - Only then proceed to next step
3. Hard gate enforcement at loop level
4. Showrunner responsibility to verify validation_report.json at every handoff

**Placement:** Inserted after "## Inputs" and before "## Procedure" for visibility

---

#### Phase 4: Gatekeeper Schema Validation Quality Bar

**New quality bar:** "Schema Validation Quality Bar (All Artifacts)"

**Position:** Added to Gatekeeper prompt after Checklist, before Cold Source of Truth Validation

**Requirements:**

Before issuing ANY `gate.decision` with `pass`, Gatekeeper MUST verify:

1. All JSON artifacts in TU have corresponding validation_report.json
2. All validation_report.json files show `"valid": true`
3. All validation_report.json files have empty `"errors": []`
4. All artifacts have `"$schema"` field pointing to canonical schema $id

**Validation Audit Protocol:**

- 7-step audit for each artifact in TU
- Check artifact has `"$schema"` field
- Verify validation_report.json structure
- BLOCK merge if any validation missing or failed
- Provide specific remediation for each failed artifact

**Hard Stops:**

- Missing validation_report.json → BLOCK
- `"valid": false` in validation_report.json → BLOCK
- Non-empty `"errors"` array → BLOCK
- Missing `"$schema"` field in artifact → BLOCK

**Enforcement:**

- List ALL artifacts with validation issues (not just first)
- Provide clear remediation for each
- Escalate to Showrunner with role assignments

**Integration:** Schema validation is prerequisite for Determinism Bar checks

---

### Changed

**Upload Kit File Counts:**

- orchestration-complete.zip: 36 → 38 files (+validation_contract.md, +SCHEMA_INDEX.json)
- full-standalone.zip: 23 → 25 files (+validation_contract.md, +SCHEMA_INDEX.json)
- minimal-standalone.zip: 10 → 12 files (+validation_contract.md, +SCHEMA_INDEX.json)
- gemini-orchestration-1-foundation.zip: 9 → 10 files (removed human_interaction.md to stay within
  limit)
- gemini-minimal-standalone.zip: 10 → 10 files (removed human_interaction.md)
- gemini-full-standalone-1.zip: 10 → 10 files (removed human_interaction.md + initialization.md)

**SCHEMA_INDEX.json Version:** 0.2.0

---

### Technical Details

**File Ordering Strategy:**

Critical insight: LLMs read uploaded files sequentially. File order determines agent behavior.

**Enforced order in all kits:**

1. validation_contract.md (file #1) ← Rules loaded FIRST
2. SCHEMA_INDEX.json (file #2) ← Discovery mechanism
3. Shared patterns ← Cross-role standards
4. Role/loop content ← Builds on validation foundation

**Implementation:** `upload_kits.py` modified to preserve manifest order when creating zips

**Three-Layer Enforcement:**

1. **Foundation Layer:** validation_contract.md loaded first sets hard gates
2. **Role Layer:** Each role knows to validate their artifacts
3. **Orchestration Layer:** Showrunner enforces validation_report.json at every handoff
4. **Quality Gate Layer:** Gatekeeper audits ALL artifacts before merge

**Result:** 0% → 100% validation compliance (expected)

---

### Migration Notes

**For existing v0.1.0 users:**

1. **Immediate impact:** Agents will see validation requirements as first loaded file
2. **Expected behavior change:**
   - Agents will perform preflight checks before producing artifacts
   - Agents will validate artifacts and emit validation_report.json
   - Invalid artifacts will cause workflow STOP (hard gate)
3. **Compatibility:** v0.1.0 kits remain available for backward compatibility
4. **Migration path:**
   - Test with v0.2.0 kits in non-production workflows
   - Verify agents produce validation_report.json correctly
   - Switch production workflows once validated

**For new users:**

- Start with v0.2.0 kits (includes validation enforcement)
- Follow validation workflow in USAGE_GUIDE.md
- Expect validation_report.json alongside all artifacts

---

### Documentation Updates

**USAGE_GUIDE.md:**

- Added "Schema Validation Workflow" section (150+ lines)
- Explains preflight protocol, validation workflow, file ordering importance
- Provides validation examples and troubleshooting

**Implementation Plan:**

- `docs/post_mortems/2025-11-06_validation_enforcement_implementation_plan.md`
- Complete 5-phase implementation plan (Phases 1-4 complete)
- Critical file ordering rules
- Success metrics and timeline

**Post-Mortem:**

- `docs/post_mortems/2025-11-06_schema_enforcement_and_validation_contracts.md`
- Root cause analysis of validation failures
- Proposed solutions and enforcement mechanisms

---

### Success Criteria

**Achieved:**

- ✅ validation_contract.md created and placed as file #1
- ✅ SCHEMA_INDEX.json generated with 26 schemas and SHA-256 hashes
- ✅ All 15 role prompts updated with validation sections
- ✅ All 13 loop playbooks updated with validation checkpoints
- ✅ Gatekeeper enhanced with schema validation quality bar
- ✅ File ordering enforced in all 14 upload kits
- ✅ All kits rebuild successfully

**Expected outcome:** 100% validation compliance for agents using v0.2.0 kits

---

### Breaking Changes

**BREAKING:** Schema validation is now mandatory. Agents producing artifacts without:

- `"$schema"` field in artifacts
- validation_report.json with `"valid": true`

Will be **blocked at merge** by Gatekeeper.

**Migration required:** Update any custom workflows to include validation steps.

## Migration Notes

### From Pre-Loop Architecture

**If you were using role prompts before commit a300224:**

1. **Keep using standalone mode** - Full role prompts still available and fully supported
2. **Try orchestration mode** - 70% context savings, clearer coordination
3. **Update Showrunner** - Now modular (5 files instead of 1)
4. **Use loop playbooks** - Single-source-of-truth procedures

**Breaking changes:** None - all previous workflows still supported via standalone mode

### Upload Kit Changes

**If you were using old upload kits:**

1. **Zips now preserve paths** - Extract with `unzip` to see directory structure
2. **New orchestration kits available** - Recommended for production
3. **Build locally** - `uv run qfspec-build-kits` for fresh kits
4. **Gemini splits provided** - 10-file limit respected

**Breaking changes:** Zip internal structure changed (but content identical)
