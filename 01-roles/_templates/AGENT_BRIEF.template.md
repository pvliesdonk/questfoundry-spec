# Agent Brief — <Canon Role Name>

> **Purpose:** A practical, human-level guide for how this role operates day-to-day. It’s a set of
> **heuristics**, not hard rules—aimed at small, testable steps that keep creativity high and
> surprises low.
>
> **Do not** include prompt text, schemas, or protocol details here. Point to Layer-0 policies
> instead of repeating them.

## 1) Operating principles (mindset)

- **Small steps win.** Prefer a narrow TU with one clear outcome over a sprawling “everything pass.”
- **Player-first surfaces.** If text can be seen by players, keep it **diegetic, spoiler-safe, and
  accessible**.
- **Hooks, not detours.** When you get an idea outside current scope, write a **hook**; don’t derail
  the TU.
- **Show, don’t tell internals.** Never surface codewords, gate logic, seeds, or technique.
- **Pair lightly.** Talk to adjacent roles for context; route cross-domain changes via the
  Showrunner.

---

## 2) Inputs & outputs (quick view)

**You usually read:**

- Hot: `<drafts, hooks, canon notes, plans relevant to the role>`
- Cold: `<player-safe surfaces you must align with (manuscript/codex/captions/etc.)>`

**You usually produce:**

- `<Named artifact(s) at human level: e.g., “Topology Notes”, “Draft Sections”, “Canon Pack”, “Codex Pack”, “Style Addendum”, “Art/Audio Plan”, “Language Pack”>`
- **Lineage**: reference TU ID in notes/footers where appropriate.

---

## 3) Small-step policy (how to slice work)

- **Scope a slice**: pick a chapter/scene/term set/asset list you can finish in one sitting.
- **Open a TU** with loop name and deliverables.
- **Timebox**: set a soft limit; if exceeded, ship what’s solid and file follow-ups as hooks.
- **Definition of done**: match the per-role checklist from the charter and pass relevant Quality
  Bars.

---

## 4) Heuristics (try this first)

- **Start with the adjacent truth.** Align to the most recent **Cold** snapshot; don’t fight it.
- **Draft fast, stabilize later.** Produce a clean first pass, flag uncertainties, and keep
  momentum.
- **Make choices contrastive.** Where applicable, options should clearly differ in intent and
  consequence.
- **Name intent, then details.** In notes, lead with “what this achieves,” then list specifics.
- **Bias to readability.** Short sentences where tension rises; exemplars beat explanations.
- **Prefer examples.** When introducing a rule or style, include one tiny before/after.

> Swap these bullets for role-specific heuristics (e.g., Plotwright: “map gateways to diegetic
> checks”; Curator: “write Overview→Usage→Context→See also”).

---

## 5) Safety rails (quick checks)

- **Spoilers**: if a line would change first-read perception, move it to Hot.
- **Internals**: never print codewords, gate logic, seeds/models, DAW/plugins.
- **Accessibility**: headings, descriptive links, alt text/captions as relevant.
- **PN phrasing**: enforce gates in-world; no meta language.

---

## 6) Communication rules

- **Notify neighbors** when your output changes their inputs (e.g., Lore → Curator; Style →
  Scene/PN).
- **Use pair guides** for common handshakes: `../interfaces/pair_guides.md`.
- **Dormancy signals**: if you need a dormant role, note it in the TU and ping the Showrunner:
  `../interfaces/dormancy_signals.md`.
- **Escalate** cross-domain conflicts via the Showrunner: `../interfaces/escalation_rules.md`.

---

## 7) When to pause & escalate

Pause and ask the **Showrunner** when:

- Your change alters topology beyond the current TU scope.
- A style or localization decision conflicts with PN principles.
- A player-surface would be clearer **only** by leaking internals (find a diegetic phrasing).
- Research is required for safety/factuality and the Researcher is dormant.

---

## 8) Tiny examples (swap with role-specific minis)

> Keep these 2–4 lines each, player-safe, and tailored to the role.

**Ambiguous choice → contrastive choice**

- Before: “Proceed through the door / Go ahead.”
- After: “Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman.”

**Meta gate → diegetic gate**

- Before: “Option locked: missing CODEWORD.”
- After: “No union token on your lapel; the guard waves you back.”

---

## 9) Done checklist (tick before handoff)

- [ ] TU updated with deliverables and notes
- [ ] Player surfaces clean (spoilers/internals absent)
- [ ] Accessibility covered (headings/links/alt/captions, as relevant)
- [ ] Neighbors notified; pair guide followed where applicable
- [ ] Gatekeeper bars likely to pass for this slice (self-check)
- [ ] Follow-up hooks filed for out-of-scope ideas
