# Gate Lifecycle — Gatecheck Decisioning and Quality Bar Enforcement

> **Status:** Normative — this document defines the canonical gatecheck lifecycle and decision flow in Layer 4 protocol.

---

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the **Gatecheck lifecycle**: the state transitions from pre-gate review through final gate decision, the three possible outcomes (pass, conditional pass, block), and how decisions map to Quality Bar status and remediation requirements.

### Purpose

Gatechecks ensure that all work merging to Cold SoT meets defined quality standards. The lifecycle ensures:

- **Quality gates enforced** — no Cold merge without gatekeeper approval
- **Clear decisions** — pass/conditional pass/block with explicit rationale
- **Actionable remediation** — smallest viable fixes identified with owners
- **Traceability** — all decisions linked to TU context and bar evidence

### Design Principles

- **Explicit bar status** — every bar gets green/yellow/red evaluation
- **Evidence-based decisions** — rationale tied to concrete observations
- **Player-safety paramount** — all evidence must be player-safe (no spoilers)
- **Minimal fixes** — remediation focuses on smallest viable change

---

## 2. State Machine

### 2.1 States

The Gatecheck lifecycle has **4 states**:

```
pre-gate → gatecheck → decision (pass | conditional pass | block)
         ↘ deferred (if TU deferred before gatecheck)
```

**States:**

- `pre-gate` — Early checkpoint; gatekeeper samples representative slice to identify likely failure points
- `gatecheck` — Formal quality bar validation; all bars evaluated
- `decision:pass` — All bars green; approved for Cold merge (terminal)
- `decision:conditional-pass` — Some bars yellow; approved with time-boxed remediation plan (terminal)
- `decision:block` — One or more bars red; blocked from Cold merge pending fixes (terminal)
- `deferred` — TU deferred before completing gatecheck (lifecycle suspended)

**Terminal states:** `decision:pass`, `decision:conditional-pass`, `decision:block` — once reached, gatecheck is complete and recorded

---

## 3. State Transitions

### 3.1 Transition Matrix

| From State  | To State                    | Allowed Sender | Intent          | Required Payload           | Notes                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-gate`  | `gatecheck`                 | GK             | `gate.submit`   | gatecheck_report (partial) | Pre-gate passed; ready for full check                       |
| `pre-gate`  | `deferred`                  | SR or GK       | `gate.defer`    | tu_brief (partial)         | TU deferred before gatecheck                                |
| `gatecheck` | `decision:pass`             | GK             | `gate.decision` | gatecheck_report (full)    | All bars green; `decision: "pass"` in payload               |
| `gatecheck` | `decision:conditional-pass` | GK             | `gate.decision` | gatecheck_report (full)    | Some bars yellow; `decision: "conditional_pass"` in payload |
| `gatecheck` | `decision:block`            | GK             | `gate.decision` | gatecheck_report (full)    | One or more bars red; `decision: "block"` in payload        |

**Role Abbreviations:**

- **GK** — Gatekeeper (quality bar enforcement authority)
- **SR** — Showrunner (can defer TU, triggering gate suspension)

---

## 4. Transition Details

### 4.1 `pre-gate` → `gatecheck`

**Preconditions:**

- Pre-gate review completed
- Representative slice sampled (not full deliverables)
- No critical red flags identified
- Owner addressed any early concerns

**Sender:** GK (Gatekeeper)

**Intent:** `gate.submit`

**Payload Schema:** `gatecheck_report.schema.json` (partial)

**Required Fields:**

```json
{
  "title": "<TU ID or View name>",
  "checked": "YYYY-MM-DD",

  "next_actions": "Owner submit full deliverables for formal gatecheck"
}
```

**Effects:**

- Pre-gate checkpoint passed
- Owner submits full deliverables
- Gatekeeper schedules full bar validation

**Error Cases:**

- `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` — if not in `pre-gate` state
- `NOT_AUTHORIZED` — if sender is not GK

- Showrunner can proceed with merge

**Error Cases:**

- `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` — if not in `gatecheck` state
- `NOT_AUTHORIZED` — if sender is not GK
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` — if any bar is not green

---

### 4.4 `gatecheck` → `decision:conditional-pass`

**Preconditions:**

- All deliverables reviewed
- All 8 bars evaluated
- Some bars status = `yellow` (but none `red`)

  "decision": "conditional pass",
  "why": "Most bars green; yellow bars have time-boxed remediation plan",
  "next_actions": "SR merge to Cold; schedule follow-up TU for yellow bars",
  "bars": [
    {
      "bar": "Style",
      "status": "yellow",
      "evidence": "<player-safe evidence of style drift>",
      "smallest_viable_fix": "<specific remediation step>",
      "owner": "ST",
      "notes": "Schedule Style Tune-up TU within 1 week"
    },
    {
      "bar": "Integrity",
      "status": "green",
      "evidence": "<player-safe evidence>"
    }
    // ... (remaining bars)

  "checklist": ["Decision: conditional pass", "Yellow bars remediation plan accepted", "Evidence player-safe", "Dormancy acknowledged", "Handoffs documented", "Trace updated"]
}
```

**Effects:**

- Gatecheck decision = `conditional pass` (terminal)
- TU approved for Cold merge with conditions
- Follow-up TU(s) scheduled for yellow bar remediation
- Handoffs documented for responsible owners

**Error Cases:**

- `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` — if not in `gatecheck` state

---

### 4.5 `gatecheck` → `decision:block`

**Preconditions:**

- All deliverables reviewed
- All 8 bars evaluated
- One or more bars status = `red`
- Remediation required before Cold merge

**Sender:** GK (Gatekeeper)

  "mode": "gatecheck",
  "cold_snapshot": "Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD",
  "artifacts_samples": ["<reviewed artifact paths>"],
  "decision": "block",
  "why": "One or more bars red; remediation required before merge",

    }
    // ... (remaining bars)
  ],
  "handoffs": ["Presentation (red) → SS: Remove spoiler from section 17 caption; resubmit within 24h"],
  "checklist": ["Decision: block", "Red bars must be green before merge", "Evidence player-safe", "Dormancy acknowledged", "Handoffs documented", "Trace updated"]
}
```

**Effects:**

- Gatecheck decision = `block` (terminal)

- `VALIDATION_FAILED` — if red bars lack smallest_viable_fix/owner
- `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` — if decision:block but no red bars present

---

## 5. Quality Bar Mapping

### 5.1 The 8 Quality Bars (from QUALITY_BARS.md)

Every gatecheck MUST evaluate all 8 bars:

1. **Integrity** — References resolve; no unintended dead ends
2. **Reachability** — Critical beats reachable via at least one viable path
3. **Nonlinearity** — Hubs/loops/gateways deliberate and meaningful
4. **Gateways** — Conditions consistent, enforceable, spoiler-safe
5. **Style** — Voice, register, motifs hold; PN in-voice
6. **Determinism** — Promised assets reproducible from parameters
7. **Presentation** — Player-safe surfaces; no spoilers or internals
8. **Accessibility** — Navigation clear; alt text present; sensory considerations respected

### 5.2 Bar Status Meanings

- **Green** — Bar requirements fully met; no remediation needed
- **Yellow** — Minor issues present; smallest viable fix identified; can proceed with follow-up
- **Red** — Critical failure; must remediate before Cold merge

### 5.3 Schema Field Mapping

Each bar entry in `gatecheck_report.schema.json` includes:

| Field                 | Required When | Purpose                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `bar`                 | Always        | Bar name (enum: 8 bars)                     |
| `status`              | Always        | green / yellow / red                        |
| `evidence`            | Always        | Player-safe observation supporting status   |
| `smallest_viable_fix` | yellow or red | Minimal remediation step                    |
| `owner`               | yellow or red | Responsible role (enum: role abbreviations) |
| `notes`               | Optional      | Additional context or reminders             |

### 5.4 Decision Logic

**Pass:**

- ALL bars = green
- `decision` = "pass"
- `handoffs` = ["None required; all bars green"]

**Conditional Pass:**

- Some bars = yellow (none red)
- `decision` = "conditional pass"
- `handoffs` = explicit list of yellow bar remediation plans with owners and due dates

**Block:**

- One or more bars = red
- `decision` = "block"
- `handoffs` = explicit list of red bar remediation plans with owners and deadlines

---

## 6. Envelope Context Requirements

All gatecheck lifecycle messages MUST include proper envelope context per `ENVELOPE.md`:

### 6.1 Hot/Cold Boundaries

- **Hot context** (`hot_cold: "hot"`):
  - Used for all gatecheck transitions
  - Gatecheck reports coordinate Hot→Cold gate, not player-facing
  - `safety.player_safe: false`, `safety.spoilers: "allowed"` (for internal gatecheck coordination)
  - **However:** All evidence in `bars[].evidence` fields MUST be player-safe (no spoilers)

- **Cold context** (`hot_cold: "cold"`):
  - Used when referencing completed gatechecks in exports
  - MUST include `snapshot` reference

### 6.2 TU Linkage

All gatecheck messages MUST include:

- `context.tu` — the TU ID being gatechecked
- `context.snapshot` — the Cold snapshot being validated
- `refs` — array of related TU/artifact IDs for traceability

### 6.3 Loop Context

All gatecheck messages MUST include:

- `context.loop` — "Gatecheck" (from loop_name enum)

---

## 7. Validation Rules

### 7.1 Bar Count Validation

**Rule:** All 8 bars MUST be present in `bars` array

- **Check:** `bars.length === 8` and all bar names from enum present
- **Error:** `VALIDATION_FAILED` if bar count ≠ 8 or bar name invalid

**Example error:**

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Gatecheck report missing required bars",
  "details": {
    "expected_bars": 8,
    "actual_bars": 7,
    "missing_bars": ["Accessibility"]
  }
}
```

### 7.2 Decision-Bar Status Consistency

**Rule:** Decision must match bar status distribution

- **Pass:** ALL bars green
- **Conditional Pass:** Some yellow, none red
- **Block:** One or more red

**Check:** Validate decision against bar statuses
**Error:** `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` if mismatch

**Example error:**

```json
{
  "code": "BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION",
  "message": "Decision 'pass' conflicts with bar status",
  "details": {
    "decision": "pass",
    "bars_with_issues": [{ "bar": "Style", "status": "yellow" }],
    "rule": "Pass decision requires all bars green"
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Evidence Player-Safety Validation

**Rule:** All `bars[].evidence` fields MUST be player-safe

- **Check:** Evidence contains no codewords, gate logic, or hidden plot details
- **Error:** `VALIDATION_FAILED` if spoilers detected

**Example error:**

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Gatecheck evidence contains spoilers",
  "details": {
    "bar": "Presentation",
    "evidence_excerpt": "...codeword ASH reveals...",
    "violation": "Codeword name exposed in evidence",
    "remedy": "Rephrase evidence in player-safe terms"
  }
}
```

### 7.4 Smallest Viable Fix Validation

**Rule:** Yellow/red bars MUST include `smallest_viable_fix` and `owner`

- **Check:** If status yellow or red, both fields present
- **Error:** `VALIDATION_FAILED` if missing

**Example error:**

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
  "message": "Yellow bar missing remediation fields",
  "details": {
    "bar": "Style",
    "status": "yellow",
    "missing_fields": ["smallest_viable_fix", "owner"],
    "rule": "Yellow/red bars require remediation plan"
  }
}
```

---

## 8. Handoff Requirements

### 8.1 Handoff Format

Each handoff in `handoffs` array MUST include:

- Bar name and status (yellow or red)
- Responsible role (owner)
- Remediation action (smallest_viable_fix summary)
- Due date or TU reference

**Example:**

```
"Style (yellow) → ST: Style Tune-up TU by 2025-11-07"
"Presentation (red) → SS: Remove spoiler from section 17; resubmit within 24h"
```

### 8.2 Escalation (Optional)

If bar failure triggers escalation:

- Use `escalation` object in gatecheck_report
- Specify `topic`, `lane`, `level` (L1/L2/L3), `bundle_attached`

**Example:**

```json
{
  "escalation": {
    "topic": "Style drift across 3 consecutive TUs",
    "lane": "ST",
    "level": "L2",
    "bundle_attached": "yes"
  }
}
```

## 11. Implementation Checklist

For implementers of Gatecheck lifecycle systems:

- [ ] Validate incoming messages against `ENVELOPE.md` requirements
- [ ] Verify `payload.data` validates against `gatecheck_report.schema.json`
- [ ] Check all 8 bars present in `bars` array
- [ ] Validate bar status consistency with decision
- [ ] Verify evidence fields are player-safe (no spoilers)
- [ ] Check yellow/red bars include smallest_viable_fix and owner
- [ ] Validate handoffs list matches yellow/red bar owners
- [ ] Generate appropriate error messages for violations
- [ ] Record gatecheck decision and trace linkage
- [ ] Emit state change events for downstream systems (TU lifecycle, Showrunner)
