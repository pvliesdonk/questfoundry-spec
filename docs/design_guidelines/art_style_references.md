## General Principles

### Cover Art vs. Interior Art

**Cover Art:**
- **Purpose:** Attract attention, signal genre, set tone
- **Composition:** Central focal point (character, scene, symbolic object)
- **Text:** Title must be readable—avoid busy backgrounds behind title area
- **Aspect Ratio:** Portrait (6:9 or 2:3) for most ebook stores

**Interior Art:**
- **Purpose:** Enhance immersion, break up text, visualize key scenes
- **Composition:** Vignettes or full-page illustrations
- **Consistency:** Maintain style across all interior illustrations
- **Frequency:** 1 per chapter or 1 per 10-15 sections (varies by budget)

### Color Theory Basics

**Warm Colors (red, orange, yellow):**
- Energy, passion, danger, comfort
- Good for: Action, romance, adventure

**Cool Colors (blue, green, purple):**
- Calm, mystery, sadness, otherworldly
- Good for: Sci-fi, mystery, fantasy, horror

**Desaturated/Grayscale:**
- Serious, historical, noir, horror
- Good for: Detective noir, historical, gothic horror

**High Contrast:**
- Drama, tension, striking visuals
- Good for: Horror, thriller, noir

### Composition Techniques

**Rule of Thirds:** Place focal points on thirds (not dead center)
**Leading Lines:** Guide eye toward focal point
**Framing:** Use environmental elements to frame subject
**Negative Space:** Empty space creates mood (isolation, dread, emptiness)
**Symmetry vs. Asymmetry:** Symmetry = order, stability; Asymmetry = tension, chaos

## AI Image Generation Tips

When using AI tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion):

### Prompt Structure

1. **Subject:** What is the main focus? (character, scene, object)
2. **Style:** Art style reference (e.g., "film noir style," "art deco poster")
3. **Mood:** Emotional tone (e.g., "atmospheric," "tense," "romantic")
4. **Lighting:** Specific lighting (e.g., "dramatic shadows," "golden hour")
5. **Color:** Color palette (e.g., "black and white with amber accents")
6. **Composition:** Camera angle, framing (e.g., "low angle," "wide shot")
7. **Details:** Specific elements (e.g., "rain," "neon signs," "venetian blinds")

### Example Prompt (Detective Noir):
```
A lone detective standing in a rain-soaked alley, film noir style, dramatic shadows from a single street lamp, black and white with amber accents, low angle shot, atmospheric and moody, venetian blind shadows on brick walls, 1940s aesthetic, high contrast
```

### Common Issues

**Too generic:** Add specific details (not just "city," but "neon-lit megacity at night")
**Wrong style:** Reference specific artists or media (e.g., "Blade Runner aesthetic")
**Bad composition:** Specify camera angle and framing (e.g., "wide cinematic shot")
**Colors off:** Be explicit about color palette (e.g., "desaturated with only red as accent color")
