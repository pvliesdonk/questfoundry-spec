### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 8.0 - 9.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 60 - 70 (Plain English)
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 7.0 - 7.9

**Rationale:** Detective noir defaults to the "Plain English" baseline. The primary goal is
**clarity**—the text must be precise and unambiguous to fairly present clues and deductions. Avoid
overly simplistic prose (condescending) and overly complex prose (obscure information).

**Critical Rule:** Regardless of prose complexity, **choice text must be simpler**—aim for low end
of range (F-K 7.0-8.0) for decision points.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Declarative sentences, terse and vivid. Mix short punchy sentences with
  occasional longer descriptive passages.
- **Tense:** Past tense common ("You examined the clue...") framing story as investigation. Present
  tense works for immediacy.
- **Vocabulary:** Accessible but atmospheric—avoid ten-dollar words, use vivid verbs and sensory
  details.

**Narrative Tone:**

- Cynical, world-weary, observant
- Morally ambiguous—protagonist is flawed
- Gritty and atmospheric (rain, smoke, shadows)
- Urban decay and social commentary

**Dialogue:**

- Snappy, sardonic, revealing subtext
- Hard-boiled wit and double entendres
- Characters speak in character (slang, period-appropriate)

**Example Opening:**

> "The dame walked into my office like trouble in a red dress. Outside, the rain hammered the
> pavement. Inside, my bourbon was getting warm. She wanted me to find someone. I wanted her to
> leave. We both knew neither was going to happen."

### Scope Variations

| Scope      | Sections | Words      | Playtime | Description                                                                               |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short**  | 150-300  | 20k-50k    | ~1hr     | Single dungeon crawl or focused quest. Character creation lite.                           |
| **Medium** | 400-800  | 50k-120k   | ~2hr     | Full adventure with character progression. 3-5 major questlines.                          |

### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 9.0 - 11.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 50 - 65
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 8.0 - 9.9

**Rationale:** Fantasy/RPG defaults to the **most difficult readability**. This is not because prose
is necessarily complex, but because readability formulas **penalize specialized, multi-syllabic,
invented vocabulary** inherent to world-building (e.g., "grimoire," "thaumaturgy," "psionic," names
of cities/gods/artifacts). This vocabulary increases Dale-Chall score (unfamiliar words) and F-K
Grade (long words).

**Don't over-simplify:** Fantasy readers expect and enjoy rich worldbuilding vocabulary. The higher
score is natural and appropriate for the genre.

**Critical Rule:** **Choice text must be simpler**—aim for F-K 7.0-8.0 for decision points, even if
surrounding prose is 10.0+.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Descriptive and "epic." Can be longer, flowing sentences for lore and
  world-building. Action scenes use shorter, punchy sentences.
- **Tense:** Second-person present ("You enter the dungeon...") or third-person past ("The hero
  ventured into...").
- **Vocabulary:** Rich in specialized fantasy terms—magic systems, creatures, locations. Must
  establish terms clearly on first use.

**Narrative Tone:**

- Epic, grand, adventurous (high fantasy)
- Dark, grim, oppressive (dark fantasy)
- Immersive world-building focus
- Strong sense of place and history

**Dialogue:**

- Varies by sub-genre (formal medieval, modern fantasy, etc.)
- Often uses archaic or formal register for gravitas
- Character voice distinguishes cultures/races

**Example Opening (Epic Fantasy):**

> "The Crystalspire looms before you, its ancient walls shimmering with residual thaumaturgy. Your
> mentor warned of the lich-king's phylactery hidden within—destroy it, or the undead legions will
> never cease. You check your grimoire one last time. Three paths lie ahead: the collapsed eastern
> gate, the sewer grate, or scaling the cliffs to the balcony."

---

### Scope Variations

| Scope      | Sections | Words    | Playtime  | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short**  | 50-150   | 5k-15k   | ~20-30min | Single night of terror. 1-2 survival paths among many deaths.                     |
| **Medium** | 200-400  | 20k-50k  | ~1hr      | Full horror scenario (haunted house, zombie outbreak). Puzzle structure.          |
| **Long**   | 400-800  | 50k-100k | ~2hr      | Extended survival campaign. Character death and restart mechanics.                |

### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 6.0 - 8.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 70 - 80
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 5.0 - 6.9

**Rationale:** Horror/thriller defaults to the **easiest readability**. The goal is **tension and
rapid pacing**, achieved with short, declarative sentences, high-frequency verbs, and visceral (but
common) language. Complex sentence structures and "ten-dollar words" slow the reader and break
immersion.

**Pacing priority:** Readability supports page-turning momentum. Simple prose = faster reading =
heightened tension.

**Critical Rule:** **Choice text must be crystal clear**—aim for F-K 5.0-6.0 for decision points to
ensure instant comprehension during high-tension moments.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Short, staccato sentences and fragments. Builds pace and urgency. "You
  run. Footsteps behind you. Closer. Closer."
- **Tense:** Present tense for immediacy ("You open the door..."). Creates in-the-moment dread.
- **Vocabulary:** Sensory and visceral—focus on sounds, smells, textures. Avoid flowery or complex
  words.

**Narrative Tone:**

- Tense, immediate, anxious
- Focus on sensory details (creaking floorboards, musty smell, cold touch)
- Atmospheric dread builds slowly before jump scares
- Isolation and vulnerability

**Dialogue:**

- Minimal (heightens isolation and dread)
- Staccato and panicked when present
- "Where are you?" "Run!" "Don't look back!"

**Example Opening:**

> "The door slams behind you. You spin. Nothing. Just darkness and the smell of rot. Somewhere
> above, floorboards creak. Slow. Deliberate. Coming closer. You have two choices: the basement
> stairs or the hallway. Both are black as pitch. Choose fast."

---

### Common Themes

- Survival against overwhelming odds
- Isolation and paranoia
- Body horror and transformation
- Psychological dread
- Ancient curses and haunted locations
- Cosmic horror and unknowable entities
- Moral choices under pressure (sacrifice, betrayal)
- Loss of control and agency
- Descent into madness

### Typical Locations

- Dark forests and isolated cabins
- Foggy small towns
- Underground tunnels and sewers
- Derelict hospitals and schools
- Graveyards and mausoleums
- Remote research facilities
- Cults' ritual sites
- Post-apocalyptic wastelands

---

### Horror Mechanics

**Fail States:**

- Frequent bad endings (death, madness, corruption)
- Signal consequence clearly ("This door looks dangerous...")
- Keep fail-state text short (25-75 words)

**Atmosphere Building:**

- Use sensory details (sounds, smells, textures)
- Build dread slowly before jump scares
- Foreshadow danger without over-explaining

**Pacing:**

- Short sections = rapid page-turning
- Occasional longer section for breather (before next scare)
- Vary tension (escalate → release → escalate)

---

### Typography

See `typography_recommendations.md` for detailed guidance.

**Recommended Pairings:**

- **Gothic Horror:** Spectral + Crimson Text (classic, unsettling)
- **Modern Horror:** Work Sans + Lora (clean, clinical, contemporary)
- **Cosmic Horror:** Libre Baskerville + Raleway (literary, otherworldly)

---

### Visual Aesthetic

See `art_style_references.md` for detailed guidance.

**Color Palette:**

- Desaturated colors (faded, sickly tones)
- Black, gray, deep reds, sickly greens
- High contrast for stark horror

- Francisco Goya (dark romanticism)

---

### Scope Variations

| Scope      | Sections | Words    | Playtime  | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Short**  | 100-200  | 15k-30k  | ~30-45min | Single-room mystery or theft investigation. 2-3 suspects.                |

---

### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 8.0 - 9.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 60 - 70 (Plain English)
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 7.0 - 7.9

**Rationale:** Mystery defaults to the "Plain English" baseline. The primary goal is
**clarity**—text must be precise and unambiguous to fairly present clues and deductions. Readers
must be able to follow logic without confusion.

**Fair play principle:** Mysteries must present all information clearly. Overly complex prose can
obscure clues unfairly.

**Critical Rule:** **Choice text and clue descriptions must be crystal clear**—aim for F-K 7.0-8.0
to ensure fair puzzle-solving.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Declarative, observational. Mix of detail-rich descriptions (clues) and
  clear, simple navigation.
- **Tense:** Past tense common ("You examined...") or present tense ("You notice...").
- **Vocabulary:** Precise and specific—avoid ambiguity. "The vase was cracked" not "The vase looked
  damaged."

**Narrative Tone:**

- Cerebral, analytical, methodical
- Observant and detail-oriented
- Suspenseful but not rushed
- Dry wit or charm (Holmesian style)

**Dialogue:**

- Interrogation-focused—reveals character, motive, alibis
- Subtext and social dynamics
- "Where were you at midnight?" "The library, as always."

**Example Opening:**

> "The body lies in the study, a single stab wound to the chest. The letter opener from the desk—now
> missing. Three suspects remain in the manor: the butler, the widow, and the business partner. Each
> claims an alibi. Only one is telling the truth. You begin your investigation."

---

### Common Themes

- Whodunit puzzle structure
- Red herrings and misdirection
- Alibi verification
- Motive, means, opportunity
- Hidden relationships and secrets
- Class dynamics (upstairs/downstairs)
- Justice vs. mercy
- Truth buried under lies
- Clever detective vs. cunning criminal

### Typical Locations

- Country manor houses (locked-room mysteries)
- Urban crime scenes
- Police stations and interrogation rooms
- Libraries and archives
- Laboratories and morgues
- Suspects' homes and offices
- Public venues (theaters, trains, hotels)
- Hidden passages and secret rooms

---

### Mystery Mechanics

**Clue Gathering:**

- Players choose which lead to investigate next
- Each path reveals 1-3 clues
- Clues can be revisited (hub structure)
- Some clues unlock new investigation paths

**Hub-and-Spoke Pattern:**

1. Central hub (detective's office, crime scene)
2. Choose which suspect/location to investigate
3. Gather clues (2-3 sections per branch)
4. Return to hub
5. New options appear based on discovered clues
6. Final accusation once sufficient clues gathered

**Win Conditions:**

- Multiple valid solutions (different levels of truth)
- Perfect solution requires finding all clues
- Partial solutions possible with incomplete evidence

---

### Scope Variations

| Scope      | Sections | Words      | Playtime | Description                                                                |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short**  | 200-400  | 30k-60k    | ~1hr     | Single romantic arc. One or two love interests.                            |

### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 8.0 - 10.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 60 - 70 (Plain English)
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 7.0 - 8.9

**Rationale:** Romance targets the "Plain English" baseline. Focus is on **emotional resonance and
character voice**. While prose can be more complex to explore internal monologues, it generally
relies on accessible language. (Note: Historical subgenres may trend higher due to setting-specific
vocabulary).

**Critical Rule:** **Dialogue choices must be clear**—aim for F-K 7.0-8.0 for decision points to
ensure readers understand emotional nuances.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Can be more complex for internal monologue and emotional exploration.
  Dialogue-heavy with emotional subtext.
- **Tense:** First-person past ("I fell for him...") or present ("I'm falling..."). Second-person
  also works.
- **Vocabulary:** Emotive language—feelings, sensations, internal reactions. Can be more "purple
  prose" for emotional beats.

**Narrative Tone:**

### Reading Difficulty

**Target Metrics (YA / Adult Audience):**

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:** 8.0 - 10.0
- **Flesch Reading Ease:** 60 - 70 (Plain English)
- **Dale-Chall Score:** 7.0 - 8.9

**Rationale:** Sci-Fi targets the "Plain English" baseline, similar to Mystery and Romance. While
sci-fi includes technical jargon, the goal is **accessibility and clarity** to explore complex ideas
without alienating readers.

**Technical jargon balance:** Introduce terms clearly, use them consistently, avoid over-loading any
single section with unexplained concepts.

**Critical Rule:** **Choice text must be clear**—aim for F-K 7.0-8.0 for decision points, even when
surrounding prose discusses complex tech concepts.

---

### Prose Style & Tone

**Language Style:**

- **Sentence Structure:** Balance between technical exposition and narrative flow. Action scenes use
  shorter sentences; world-building can be more complex.
- **Tense:** Varies—present for immediacy, past for retrospective framing.
- **Vocabulary:** Jargon-rich but accessible. Establish terms on first use. (e.g., "You jack into
  the mainframe—plug the neural interface behind your ear...")

**Narrative Tone:**

- Hardboiled and noir (cyberpunk)
- Epic and optimistic (space opera)
- Clinical and precise (hard sci-fi)
- Philosophical and questioning (ethical dilemmas)

**Dialogue:**

- Can be jargon-heavy but must remain comprehensible
- Characters speak in-world (tech slang, corporate-speak)
- "Run the ICE-breaker. We've got thirty seconds before security traces us."

**Example Opening (Cyberpunk):**

> "The neon rain hammers the pavement outside your cube. Another sleepless night jacked into the
> net, running data for corporations that would kill you if they knew who you really were. Tonight's
> job: infiltrate Arasaka's mainframe, ghost the security AI, and extract the encrypted files. Three
> routes in: brute-force the firewall, social-engineer an access code, or buy a backdoor from your
> fixer. Each has risks. Choose fast—the target window closes in ten minutes."
