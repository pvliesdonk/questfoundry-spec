# Canon Transfer Package — Export Canon for Shared Universes (Layer 2, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **NEW ARTIFACT TYPE** (2025-11-10)
>
> **Use:** Package stabilized canon from a completed project for export to downstream projects
> (sequels, shared universes, franchise continuity). Invariant canon rules must be honored; mutable
> canon can be extended. Enables **Canon Transfer** workflow.

## 2) Invariant Canon (Immutable Rules)

<!-- Field: Invariant Canon | Type: array | Required: yes | Canon pack elements that cannot change -->
<!-- Validation: Each element must have: ID, Theme, Canon content, Rationale for immutability -->
<!-- Cross-field: All entity references must resolve to Entity Registry (§6) -->

> **Immutable in downstream projects.** These canon rules must remain true; violating them breaks
> continuity.

**Format (per invariant):**

```

[INV-01] <canon-pack-id>: <theme>
Canon: <2-6 lines; spoiler-level detail allowed>
Rationale: <why immutable: "Core world rule", "Source project resolution", "Franchise constraint">
Consequences: <what this enables/constrains for downstream projects>

```

**Example:**

```

[INV-01] CP-Geography-001: Wormhole Collapse
Canon: Wormhole 3 collapsed in Y-18 due to containment failure; irreparable with current technology. All trade routes rerouted; economic impact permanent.
Rationale: Core resolution of source project; downstream cannot reverse.
Consequences: Downstream stories cannot repair Wormhole 3; must work around collapse.

[INV-02] CP-Factions-003: Toll Syndicate Structure
Canon: Toll Syndicate has 5-tier hierarchy (Operators, Brokers, Intermediaries, Shadows, Council); structure unchanged for 30 years.
Rationale: Franchise constraint; hierarchy is foundational to cross-project continuity.
Consequences: Downstream can add members but not change tier structure.

```

_(Repeat per invariant canon element.)_

---

## 3) Mutable Canon (Extensible Rules)

<!-- Field: Mutable Canon | Type: array | Required: yes | Canon pack elements that can be extended -->
<!-- Validation: Each element must have: ID, Theme, Canon content, Extension guidance -->
<!-- Cross-field: All entity references must resolve to Entity Registry (§6) -->

> **Extensible in downstream projects.** These canon rules can be detailed/extended but not
> contradicted.

**Format (per mutable):**

```

[MUT-01] <canon-pack-id>: <theme>
Canon: <2-6 lines; current state>
Extension Guidance: <how downstream can extend: "Add members", "Expand geography", "Detail timeline">
Constraints: <what cannot change: "Cannot remove existing members", "Cannot move landmarks">

```

**Example:**

```

[MUT-01] CP-Factions-004: Toll Syndicate Members
Canon: 5 known Toll Syndicate council members (Kael, Rina, Torv, Senna, Macks); roster incomplete.
Extension Guidance: Downstream can add new council members, expand lower-tier rosters.
Constraints: Cannot remove existing 5 council members; cannot change tier assignments.

[MUT-02] CP-Geography-002: Dock 7 Layout
Canon: Dock 7 has 12 berths, inspection station, union hall; partial map available.
Extension Guidance: Downstream can expand dock layout (add berths, warehouses, facilities).
Constraints: Cannot relocate inspection station or union hall (landmarks from source).

```

_(Repeat per mutable canon element.)_

---

## 4) Codex Baseline (Player-Safe Entries)

<!-- Field: Codex Baseline | Type: array | Required: yes | Player-safe codex entries for universe-wide transfer -->
<!-- Validation: Each entry must be spoiler-free, player-safe, inherited flag set -->
<!-- Cross-field: All cross-refs must resolve to other codex entries or Entity Registry -->

> **Player-safe encyclopedia.** Inherited codex entries for downstream projects; mark as
> `source: <project-slug>`.

**Format (per entry):**

```

[CODEX-01] <entry-title>
Topic: <concept, place, procedure>
Player-Safe Text (2-4 lines): "<neutral description that enables choices without revealing spoilers>"
Cross-Refs: <see-also entries>
Inherited: true
Source: <source-project-slug>

```

**Example:**

```

[CODEX-01] Dock Inspections
Topic: Procedures
Player-Safe Text: "Dock inspections are stricter than they used to be; badges are checked by sight, and logs are kept clean. Union tokens must be visually verifiable under dock lighting."
Cross-Refs: Union Tokens, Inspection Logs, Dock 7
Inherited: true
Source: lighthouse-keeper

[CODEX-02] Union Tokens
Topic: Items
Player-Safe Text: "Union-issued badges that grant dock access. Visual verification required; counterfeit tokens are prosecuted. Tokens display rank and clearance level."
Cross-Refs: Dock Inspections, Dock Workers Union
Inherited: true
Source: lighthouse-keeper

[CODEX-03] Wormhole Physics
Topic: Metaphysics
Player-Safe Text: "Wormholes enable faster-than-light travel by bending spacetime. Containment failures are catastrophic and irreparable with current technology."
Cross-Refs: Wormhole 3, Trade Routes
Inherited: true
Source: lighthouse-keeper

```

_(Repeat per codex entry.)_

---

## 5) Timeline Anchors

<!-- Field: Timeline Anchors | Type: array | Required: yes | T0/T1/T2 from source project -->
<!-- Validation: Must include at least T0 (past), T2 (source project "now"); T1 optional but recommended -->
<!-- Cross-field: Timeline must be chronologically ordered -->

> **Past events from source project.** Downstream projects extend timeline as T3/T4/...

**Format:**

```

T0 <past anchor>: <event> — <who involved> — <where>
T1 <recent>: <event> — <effect on present>
T2 <now>: <state at end of source project>

Extension for downstream: T3+ available for new project events

```

**Example:**

```

T0 (Y-18): Wormhole 3 collapse — Containment failure — Sector 7
   → Economic disruption; trade routes rerouted permanently

T1 (Y-5): Union reforms — Safety regulations tightened — All docks
   → Inspection protocols stricter; badge verification mandatory

T2 (Y+0): Source project end state — Toll Syndicate exposed, Kestrel reformed
   → Political tension high; Union oversight increased

Extension for downstream: T3 = Y+2 (suggested start for sequel)

```

## 6) Entity Registry

<!-- Field: Entity Registry | Type: array | Required: yes | All entities defined in source project -->
<!-- Validation: Must include: Name, Type (character/place/faction/item), Status, Description -->
<!-- Cross-field: All entity references in Invariant/Mutable canon must resolve to this registry -->

> **Complete entity catalog.** All characters, places, factions, items defined in source project.

**Format (per entity type):**

## 7) Downstream Constraints (for Plotwright/Scene Smith)

<!-- Field: Downstream Constraints | Type: markdown-list | Required: yes | Clear rules for downstream projects -->
<!-- Validation: Must include: Invariants (cannot change), Mutables (can extend), Timeline guidance, Entity baseline -->

> **Actionable rules for downstream creative roles.** What can/cannot change.

```

Invariants (CANNOT CHANGE):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Wormhole 3 collapsed in Y-18 (irreparable)
- Toll Syndicate has 5-tier hierarchy (structure fixed)
- Kestrel Var reformed; Toll Syndicate exposed (source resolution)


Mutables (CAN EXTEND):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Toll Syndicate member roster (can add members; cannot remove existing 5 council)
- Dock 7 layout (can expand berths/facilities; cannot relocate landmarks)
- Character fates (Kestrel/Ena statuses can evolve; cannot contradict source end state)


Timeline Guidance:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Source project ends at Y+0
- Suggested downstream start: Y+2 (2 years later)
- Extend timeline as T3/T4/...


Entity Baseline:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- 2 characters (Kestrel, Ena) with defined statuses
- 3 places (Dock 7, Wormhole 3, Union Hall)
- 2 factions (Toll Syndicate, Union)
- 2 items (Union Token, Plasma Scanner)


You CAN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Add new Toll Syndicate members
✓ Expand Dock 7 geography
✓ Introduce new characters
✓ Explore consequences of source events
✓ Extend character arcs (Kestrel/Ena)


You CANNOT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✗ Repair Wormhole 3 (violates invariant)
✗ Change Toll hierarchy structure (violates invariant)
✗ Contradict Kestrel/Ena end states (violates entity registry)
✗ Remove existing council members (violates mutable constraints)

```

## Common Errors

**❌ Entity reference broken**

- Wrong: Invariant canon references "House Vaelen" but not in Entity Registry
- Right: All entities in canon must exist in Entity Registry

**❌ Timeline out of order**

- Wrong: T2 (Y-5), T1 (Y-18), T0 (Y+0)
- Right: T0 (Y-18), T1 (Y-5), T2 (Y+0) — chronological order

**❌ Codex baseline contains spoilers**

- Wrong: "Kestrel betrayed the Toll Syndicate in the final act."
- Right: "Dock inspections are stricter than they used to be."

**❌ Invariant/Mutable distinction unclear**

- Wrong: Canon marked as invariant but with "can extend" guidance
- Right: Invariant = immutable, Mutable = extensible

**❌ Snapshot ID mismatch**

- Wrong: Package says "v1.0" but source project snapshot is "v2.0"
- Right: Snapshot ID must match source project's actual Cold tag

**❌ Missing constraint documentation**

- Wrong: No "You CAN/CANNOT" guidance for downstream
- Right: Clear examples of allowed/forbidden changes
