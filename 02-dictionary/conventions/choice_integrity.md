# Choice Integrity — Converge Without Fake Agency

Definitions

- Immediate reflection: when sibling choices converge, the next scene’s first paragraph reflects the
  chosen path (lexical, behavioral, or situational). Not necessarily a literal echo, but perceivable
  to the player.
- Diegetic bridge: a short, in-world transit line that bridges anchors and preserves causality.
- State-aware affordances: at least one option reads differently based on the entering state.
- Micro-beat between: a short beat inserted between scenes (when convergence is necessary) that sets
  a visible state flag and can grow into a larger scene if warranted.

Guidelines

- Avoid early funneling: the first-choice options must not be functionally equivalent (same
  destination and same opening experience).
- If convergence is required, add a micro-beat between, then ensure immediate reflection and
  condition at least one affordance by state.
- GK blocks at pre-gate if these are missing; provide smallest viable fixes.

Examples (sketches)

- Bridge: “You follow the hush-buyers under the tin awnings toward the ledger shed.”
- Reflection (stamped): “Your wrist stamp glows green; the clerk barely looks up.”
- Reflection (cadence): “Your hum trails off; the clerk’s eyes linger on your lips.”
- State-aware affordance: “Waved to inner queue” vs “Step aside for verification.”
