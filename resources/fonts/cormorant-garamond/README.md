## About Cormorant

Cormorant is a free display font family developed by Christian Thalmann. The Garamond variant is
inspired by Claude Garamond's classical typefaces, making it ideal for literary titles and headers.

**Design Characteristics:**

- Elegant serifs with fine details
- High contrast between thick and thin strokes
- Excellent for display sizes (titles, headers)
- Pairs well with Source Serif 4 for body text

Once installed, Book Binder will automatically detect and embed these fonts in EPUB exports.
